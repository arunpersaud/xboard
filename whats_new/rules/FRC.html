        <h3>Initial setup</h3>

        <p>There is no fixed setup; the back-rank pieces are
        randomly shuffled with certain restrictions. Black's setup
        is the mirror image of white's, though. Both sides
        have:</p>

        <p>1 King<br>
        1 Queen<br>
        2 Rooks<br>
        2 Bishops<br>
        2 Knights<br>
        a2-j2, a7-j7: Pawns</p>

        <p>The Bishops must start on different colors. The King
        must start between the Rooks.</p>

  <h3>Pawn peculiarities</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Pawns capture differently from how they move (straight
    move, diagonal capture).</li>

    <li>Pawns can move two squares ahead from their initial
    position, provided they are not blocked.</li>

    <li>On the move immediately after such a double push, they can
    be captured en passant by another Pawn, as if they had only
    moved 1 square ahead.</li>

    <li>Pawns promote to another (non-royal) piece of choice when
    they reach last rank.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Castling</h3>

  <p>A King that has not moved before can move to the c1/c8 or
  g1/g8 in the direction of a Rook that has not moved before, in
  which case that Rook is moved to the square on the other side
  next to the King. This is only allowed if all squares traveled
  through by King and Rook are empty (after their removal), when
  the King is not in check on the square it came from, and would
  not be in check on any of the squares it skipped over.</p>

  <h3>General rules</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>It is not allowed to expose your King to check.</li>

    <li>The game is won by checkmating the opponent's King.</li>

    <li>Stalemate (no legal moves, but not in check) is a
    draw.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>XBoard interface issues</h3>

  <p>You can use the New Shuffle dialog to control the
  randomization of the initial position.</p>

  <h3>Differences with FIDE</h3>

  <p>The start position is not fixed, but randomly picked. Castling
  is generalized to allow it with non-standard placement of King
  and Rooks.</p>

  <h3>Strategy issues</h3>

  <p>It is not possible to force checkmate on a bare King with just
  a single Bishop or Knight (in addition to your own King). Two
  Knights cannot do that either.</p>

  <p>Bishops are confined to squares of a single color. Having
  Bishops on both colors compensates this weakness, and is worth an
  extra 0.5 on top of their added value.</p>
