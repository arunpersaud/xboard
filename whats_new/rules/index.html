  <h1>Chess variants supported by XBoard</h1>

  <p>Next to orthodox Chess (aka FIDE or Mad Queen), XBoard
  supports many other Chess variants. This includes the World's
  major forms of Chess: Chinese, FIDE, Japanese, and Thai Chess.
  But also many popular western variants (Suicide Chess,
  Crazyhouse, Chess960, Gothic/Capablanca Chess, Seirawan
  Chess).</p>

  <p>Full support by XBoard means that the latter is fully aware of
  how all pieces move, and what the winning condition is. This
  means the variant can be played with the option Test Legality
  switched on, and that it can accurately check any result claims
  that engines make. Non-supported variants can often be played
  with legality checking switched off. Then any of the 22 piece
  types known by XBoard can be used in ways XBoard does not expect.
  The only real drawback of this is that the game notation looks a
  bit crummy, with many spurious or missing disambiguators, check
  and checkmate symbols. XBoard will always be able to read suh
  games back, however (as on reading it suffers from the same
  misconceptions on piece movement). This can be kept baerable by
  choosing XBoard supported pieces to represent the unsupported
  ones that move as similar as possible.</p>

  <p>Some variants are only partially supported. This means they
  have to be played with legality checking off, although XBoard
  knows they exist, and even implements some of their rules that no
  other variant would allow. For instance, in Berolina Chess Pawns
  move diagonally, and in any other variant this would lead to
  disappearence of other Pawns during the game, as normally XBoard
  interprets a diagonal Pawn move to an empty square as e.p.
  capture.</p>

  <p>The following list tries to group all variants by properties.
  Some duplicates occur when a variant fits in more than one
  group.</p>
