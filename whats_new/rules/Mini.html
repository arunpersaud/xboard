  <h3>Pawn peculiarities</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Pawns move <b>and capture</b> straight ahead.</li>

    <li>It is forbidded to have more than one Pawn in the same
    file.</li>

    <li>It is forbidden to checkmate the opponent with a Pawn
    drop.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>General rules</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>The game is won by capturing the opponent's King.</li>

    <li>Pieces captured change color, and are kept in hand by the
    side who captured them. In stead of a normal move, such pieces
    can be dropped at any later time.</li>

    <li>Pieces cannot be moved or dropped to a location where all
    their moves would go off board.</li>

    <li>Pieces optionally promote at the end of a move into, in or
    out of the promotion zone.</li>

    <li>The promotion zone consists of the last rank.</li>

    <li>Pieces obtained by promotion revert to their original form
    on capture.</li>

    <li>Perpetual checking is forbidden, and would be ruled a loss
    on the 4-fold repeat.</li>

    <li><b>On other 4-fold repetitions white loses.</b></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>XBoard interface issues</h3>

  <p>Mini-Shogi is (not yet) a standard variant in XBoard. It has
  to be played in XBoard by selecting regular Shogi after having
  set the board- and holdings-size overrides in the New Variant
  dialog all to 5 (i.e. 5x5 board, and holdings for 5 piece types).
  This is not all, however; the pieceToCharTable has to be changed
  to tell XBoard that the Lance and Knight do not participate. (In
  regular Shogi they would, but here they would push Silver and
  Gold out of the holdings!) This can unfortunately only be done
  through command-line options.</p>

  <p>It is therefore best to put all options needed to massage
  XBoard into playing this variant in a settings file mini.xop. On
  install .xop files are associated with XBoard, so clicking them
  would start XBoard with the options in that file. You could then
  set everything in the file needed to start in mini-Shogi
  mode:</p>
  <pre>
-variant shogi
-boardHeight 5
-boardWidth 5
-holdingsSize 5
-pieceToCharTable "P.BR.S...G.+.++.+Kp.br.s...g.+.++.+k"
</pre>Since the game is just a subset of regular Shogi, legality
testing can remain on. You could also specify your favorite
mini-Shogi engine with -fcp in that file.

  <p>You can drop pieces by dragging them onto the board from the
  holdings displayed beside the board.</p>

  <p>Of course there will always be people that prefer an oriental
  look, with pentagonal kanji tiles. XBoard comes with a set of
  kanji pieces in the 'themes/shogi' sub-directory of its data
  directory (e.g. /usr/local/share/games/xboard). You can select
  that as -pieceImageDirectory (-pid for short) from the command
  line, or from the View -&gt; Board dialog. You would also have to
  tick 'Flip black pieces Shogi style' there (or use the option
  <b>-flipBlack true</b>) to make sure the pieces won't go upside
  down when you flip the view.</p>

  <h3>Differences with FIDE</h3>

  <p>In stead of Queens you have Silver and Gold Generals. Pawns
  capture straight ahead. Captured pieces can later be dropped to
  augment the army of their capturer. There is no castling, Pawn
  double-push or e.p. capture.</p>

  <h3>Strategy issues</h3>

  <p>Because pieces are dropped back, there will not be a
  traditional end-game. Trading material does not constitute
  progress towards winning, even when you are ahead.</p>

  <p>Because Gold Generals obtained through promotion revert to
  their original form on capture, they are really different piece
  types from the primordial Golds that move the same. In notation
  they are therefore not indicated as 'G', but as the ID of the
  original piece prefixed with a '+'. Especially the promoted Pawn
  (aka Tokin) is more valuable: it is much better to lose a Gold
  that gives the opponent a Pawn in hand, than to lose a Gold that
  gives him a Gold in hand.</p>

  <p>It is a big advantage to have a General on the central
  square.</p>

  <p>Pieces in hand are in general worth more than on the board, as
  they are much more mobile. And you can drop them in the promotion
  for an easy promotion on the next turn. But pieces in hand cannot
  capture anything, and don't guard your promotion zone.</p>
