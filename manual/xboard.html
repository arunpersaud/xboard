<h2 class="unnumbered">Introduction</h2>

<p><a name="index-introduction-1"></a>

   <p>XBoard is a graphical chessboard that can serve as a
user interface to chess engines (such as GNU Chess), the
Internet Chess Servers,
electronic mail correspondence chess, or your own collection of saved games.

   <p>This manual documents version 4.4.0j of XBoard.

<h2 class="chapter">1 Major modes</h2>

<p><a name="index-Major-modes-2"></a>
XBoard always runs in one of four major modes.  You select the
major mode from the command line when you start up XBoard.

     <dl>
<dt>xboard [options]<dd>As an interface to GNU Chess or another chess engine running on your
machine, XBoard lets you play a game against the machine,
set up arbitrary positions, force variations, watch a game between two
chess engines, interactively analyze your stored games or set up and
analyze arbitrary positions.  (Note: Not all chess engines support
analysis.) 
<br><dt>xboard -ics -icshost hostname [options]<dd>As Internet Chess Server (ICS) interface, XBoard
lets you play against other ICS users, observe games
they are playing, or review games that have recently finished.  Most
of the ICS "wild" chess variants are supported, including bughouse. 
<br><dt>xboard -ncp [options]<dd>XBoard can also be used simply
as an electronic chessboard to play through games. It will read and
write game files and allow you to play through variations
manually. You can use it to browse games off the net or review games
you have saved.  These features are also available in the other modes. 
<br><dt>|pxboard<dd>If you want to pipe games into XBoard, use the supplied shell
script <samp><span class="file">pxboard</span></samp>.  For example, from the news reader <samp><span class="file">xrn</span></samp>,
find a message with one or more games in it, click the Save button,
and type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|pxboard</span></samp>&rsquo; as the file name. 
<br><dt>cmail [options]<dd>As an interface to electronic mail correspondence chess, XBoard
works with the cmail program. See <a href="#CMail">CMail</a> below for
instructions.

<h2 class="chapter">2 Menus, buttons, and keys</h2>

<p><a name="index-Menus-3"></a>
To move a piece, you can drag it with the left mouse button, or you
can click the left mouse button once on the piece, then once more on
the destination square.  To drop a new piece on a square (when
applicable), press the middle or the right mouse button over the
square and select from the popup menu.  In cases where you can drop
either a white or black piece, use the middle button (or shift+right)
for white and the right button (or shift+middle) for black.  When you
are playing a bughouse game on an Internet Chess Server, a list of the
offboard pieces that each player has available is shown in the window
title after the player's name; in addition, the piece menus show the
number of pieces available of each type. From version 4.3.14 on, it is
also possible in crazyhouse, bughouse or shogi to dag and drop pieces
to the board from the holdings squares displayed next to the board.

   <p>All other XBoard commands are available from the menu bar. The most
frequently used commands also have shortcut keys or on-screen buttons.

   <p>When XBoard is iconized, its graphical icon is a white knight if
it is White's turn to move, a black knight if it is Black's turn.  See
Iconize in <a href="#Keys">Keys</a> below if you have problems getting this
feature to work.

<h3 class="section">2.1 File Menu</h3>

<p><a name="index-File-Menu-4"></a><a name="index-Menu_002c-File-5"></a>
     <dl>
<dt>New Game<dd><a name="index-New-Game_002c-Menu-Item-6"></a>Resets XBoard and the chess engine to the beginning of a new chess
game. The <kbd>r</kbd> key is a keyboard equivalent. In Internet Chess
Server mode, clears the current state of XBoard, then
resynchronizes with the ICS by sending a refresh command. If you want to
stop playing, observing, or examining an ICS game, use an
appropriate command from the Action menu, not &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">New Game</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
See <a href="#Action-Menu">Action Menu</a>. 
<br><dt>New Shuffle Game<dd><a name="index-New-Shuffle-Game_002c-Menu-Item-7"></a>Similar to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">New Game</span></samp>&rsquo;, but allows you to specify a particular initial position
(according to a standardized numbering system)
in chess variants which use randomized opening positions (e.g. Chess960). 
The selected opening position will persistently be chosen on any following
New Game command until you use this menu to select another. Selecting
position number -1 will produce a newly randomized position on any new game. 
Using this menu item in variants that normally do not shuffle their opening position
does cause these variants to become shuffle variants until you use the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">New Shuffle Game</span></samp>&rsquo; menu to explicitly switch the randomization off,
or select a new variant. 
<br><dt>New Variant<dd><a name="index-New-variant_002c-Menu-Item-8"></a>Allows you to select a new chess variant in non-ICS mode. 
(In ICS play, the ICS is responsible for deciding which variant will be played,
and XBoard adapts autmatically.) If you play with an engine, the engine must
be able to play the selected variant, or the command will be ignored. 
XBoard supports all major variants, such as xiangqi, shogi, chess, chess960,
Capablanca Chess, shatranj, crazyhous, bughouse. 
<br><dt>Load Game<dd><a name="index-Load-Game_002c-Menu-Item-9"></a>Plays a game from a record file. The <kbd>g</kbd> key is a keyboard equivalent. 
A popup dialog prompts you for the file name. If the file contains more
than one game, a second popup dialog
displays a list of games (with information drawn from their PGN tags, if
any), and you can select the one you want. Alternatively, you can load the
Nth game in the file directly, by typing the number <kbd>N</kbd> after the
file name, separated by a space.

     <p>The game file parser will accept PGN (portable game notation),
or in fact almost any file that contains moves in algebraic
notation. 
Notation of the form &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">P@f7</span></samp>&rsquo;
is accepted for piece-drops in bughouse games;
this is a nonstandard extension to PGN. 
If the file includes a PGN position (FEN tag), or an old-style
XBoard position diagram bracketed by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[--</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--]</span></samp>&rsquo;
before the first move, the game starts from that position. Text
enclosed in parentheses, square brackets, or curly braces is assumed to
be commentary and is displayed in a pop-up window. Any other
text in the file is ignored. PGN variations (enclosed in
parentheses) are treated as comments; XBoard is not able to walk
variation trees. 
The nonstandard PGN tag [Variant "varname"] functions similarly to
the -variant command-line option (see below), allowing games in certain chess
variants to be loaded.  There is also a heuristic to
recognize chess variants from the Event tag, by looking for the strings
that the Internet Chess Servers put there when saving variant ("wild") games. 
<br><dt>Load Next Game<dd><a name="index-Load-Next-Game_002c-Menu-Item-10"></a>Loads the next game from the last game record file you loaded. 
The shifted <kbd>N</kbd> key is a keyboard equivalent. 
<br><dt>Load Previous Game<dd><a name="index-Load-Previous-Game_002c-Menu-Item-11"></a>Loads the previous game from the last game record file you
loaded.  The shifted <kbd>P</kbd> key is a keyboard equivalent. 
Not available if the last game was loaded from a pipe. 
<br><dt>Reload Same Game<dd><a name="index-Reload-Same-Game_002c-Menu-Item-12"></a>Reloads the last game you loaded. 
Not available if the last game was loaded from a pipe. 
<br><dt>Save Game<dd><a name="index-Save-Game_002c-Menu-Item-13"></a>Appends a record of the current game to a file. 
A popup dialog
prompts you for the file name. If the game did not begin with
the standard starting position, the game file includes the
starting position used. Games are saved in the PGN (portable
game notation) format, unless the oldSaveStyle option is true,
in which case they are saved in an older format that is specific
to XBoard. Both formats are human-readable, and both can be
read back by the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Load Game</span></samp>&rsquo; command. 
Notation of the form &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">P@f7</span></samp>&rsquo;
is accepted for piece-drops in bughouse games;
this is a nonstandard extension to PGN. 
<br><dt>Copy Game<dd><a name="index-Copy-Game_002c-Menu-Item-14"></a>Copies a record of the current game to an internal clipboard in PGN
format and sets the X selection to the game text.  The game can be
pasted to another application (such as a text editor or another copy
of XBoard) using that application's paste command.  In many X
applications, such as xterm and emacs, the middle mouse button can be
used for pasting; in XBoard, you must use the Paste Game command. 
<br><dt>Paste Game<dd><a name="index-Paste-Game_002c-Menu-Item-15"></a>Interprets the current X selection as a game record and loads it, as
with Load Game. 
<br><dt>Load Position<dd><a name="index-Load-Position_002c-Menu-Item-16"></a>Sets up a position from a position file.  A popup dialog prompts
you for the file name. If the file contains more than one saved
position, and you want to load the Nth one, type the number N
after the file name, separated by a space. Position files must
be in FEN (Forsythe-Edwards notation), or in the format that the
Save Position command writes when oldSaveStyle is turned on. 
<br><dt>Load Next Position<dd><a name="index-Load-Next-Position_002c-Menu-Item-17"></a>Loads the next position from the last position file you loaded. 
<br><dt>Load Previous Position<dd><a name="index-Load-Previous-Position_002c-Menu-Item-18"></a>Loads the previous position from the last position file you
loaded.  Not available if the last position was loaded from a pipe. 
<br><dt>Reload Same Position<dd><a name="index-Reload-Same-Position_002c-Menu-Item-19"></a>Reloads the last position you loaded. 
Not available if the last position was loaded from a pipe. 
<br><dt>Save Position<dd><a name="index-Save-Game_002c-Menu-Item-20"></a>Appends a diagram of the current position to a file. 
A popup dialog
prompts you for the file name. Positions are saved in
FEN (Forsythe-Edwards notation) format unless the <code>oldSaveStyle</code>
option is true, in which case they are saved in an older,
human-readable format that is specific to XBoard. Both formats
can be read back by the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Load Position</span></samp>&rsquo; command. 
<br><dt>Copy Position<dd><a name="index-Copy-Position_002c-Menu-Item-21"></a>Copies the current position to an internal clipboard in FEN format and
sets the X selection to the position text.  The position can be pasted
to another application (such as a text editor or another copy of
XBoard) using that application's paste command.  In many X
applications, such as xterm and emacs, the middle mouse button can be
used for pasting; in XBoard, you must use the Paste Position command. 
<br><dt>Paste Position<dd><a name="index-Paste-Position_002c-Menu-Item-22"></a>Interprets the current X selection as a FEN position and loads it, as
with Load Position. 
<br><dt>Mail Move<dt>Reload CMail Message<dd><a name="index-Mail-Move_002c-Menu-Item-23"></a><a name="index-Reload-CMail-Message_002c-Menu-Item-24"></a>See <a href="#CMail">CMail</a>. 
<br><dt>Exit<dd><a name="index-Exit_002c-Menu-Item-25"></a>Exits from XBoard. The shifted <kbd>Q</kbd> key is a keyboard equivalent.

<h3 class="section">2.2 Mode Menu</h3>

<p><a name="index-Menu_002c-Mode-26"></a><a name="index-Mode-Menu-27"></a>
     <dl>
<dt>Machine White<dd><a name="index-Machine-White_002c-Menu-Item-28"></a>Tells the chess engine to play White. 
<br><dt>Machine Black<dd><a name="index-Machine-Black_002c-Menu-Item-29"></a>Tells the chess engine to play Black. 
<br><dt>Two Machines<dd><a name="index-Two-Machines_002c-Menu-Item-30"></a>Plays a game between two chess engines. 
<br><dt>Analysis Mode<dd><a name="index-Analysis-Mode_002c-Menu-Item-31"></a>XBoard tells the chess engine to start analyzing the current game/position
and shows you the analysis as you move pieces around. 
Note: Some chess engines do not support Analysis mode.

     <p>To set up a position to analyze, you do the following:

     <p>1. Select Edit Position from the Mode Menu

     <p>2. Set up the position.  Use the middle and right buttons to
bring up the white and black piece menus.

     <p>3. When you are finished, click on either the Black or White
clock to tell XBoard which side moves first.

     <p>4. Select Analysis Mode from the Mode Menu to start the analysis.

     <p>The analysis function can also be used when observing games on an ICS
with an engine loaded (zippy mode); the engine then will analyse
the positions as they occur in the observed game. 
<br><dt>Analyze File<dd><a name="index-Analyze-File_002c-Menu-Item-32"></a>This option lets you load a game from a file (PGN, XBoard format, etc.) 
and analyze it. When you select this menu item, a popup window appears
and asks for a filename to load. 
If the file contains multiple games, another popup appears that lets
you select which game you wish to analyze. 
After a game is loaded, use the XBoard arrow buttons to step
forwards/backwards through the game and watch the analysis. 
Note: Some chess engines do not support Analysis mode. 
<br><dt>ICS Client<dd><a name="index-ICS-Client_002c-Menu-Item-33"></a>This is the normal mode when XBoard
is connected to a chess server.  If you have moved into
Edit Game or Edit Position mode, you can select this option to get out.

     <p>To use xboard in ICS mode, run it in the foreground with the -ics
option, and use the terminal you started it from to type commands and
receive text responses from the chess server.  See
<a href="#Chess-Servers">Chess Servers</a> below for more information.

     <p>XBoard activates some special position/game editing features when you
use the <kbd>examine</kbd> or <kbd>bsetup</kbd> commands on ICS and you have
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ICS Client</span></samp>&rsquo; selected on the Mode menu.  First, you can issue the
ICS position-editing commands with the mouse.  Move pieces by dragging
with mouse button 1.  To drop a new piece on a square, press mouse
button 2 or 3 over the square.  This brings up a menu of white pieces
(button 2) or black pieces (button 3).  Additional menu choices let
you empty the square or clear the board.  Click on the White or Black
clock to set the side to play.  You cannot set the side to play or
drag pieces to arbitrary squares while examining on ICC, but you can
do so in <kbd>bsetup</kbd> mode on FICS.  In addition, the menu commands
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Forward</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Backward</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Pause</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Stop Examining</span></samp>&rsquo;
have special functions in this mode; see below. 
<br><dt>Edit Game<dd><a name="index-Edit-Game_002c-Menu-Item-34"></a>Allows you to make moves for both Black and White, and to change
moves after backing up with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Backward</span></samp>&rsquo; command. The clocks do
not run.

     <p>In chess engine mode, the chess engine continues to check moves for legality
but does not participate in the game. You can bring the chess engine
into the game by selecting &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Machine White</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Machine Black</span></samp>&rsquo;,
or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Two Machines</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>In ICS mode, the moves are not sent to the ICS: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Edit Game</span></samp>&rsquo; takes
XBoard out of ICS Client mode and lets you edit games locally. 
If you want to edit games on ICS in a way that other ICS users
can see, use the ICS <kbd>examine</kbd> command or start an ICS match
against yourself. 
<br><dt>Edit Position<dd><a name="index-Edit-Position_002c-Menu-Item-35"></a>Lets you set up an arbitrary board position. 
Use mouse button 1 to drag pieces to new squares, or to delete a piece
by dragging it off the board or dragging an empty square on top of it. 
To drop a new piece on a square, press mouse button 2 or 3 over the
square. This brings up a menu of white pieces (button 2) or
black pieces (button 3). Additional menu choices let you empty the
square or clear the board. You can set the side to play next by
clicking on the word White or Black at the top of the screen. 
Selecting &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Edit Position</span></samp>&rsquo; causes XBoard to discard
all remembered moves in the current game.

     <p>In ICS mode, changes made to the position by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Edit Position</span></samp>&rsquo; are
not sent to the ICS: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Edit Position</span></samp>&rsquo; takes XBoard out of
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ICS Client</span></samp>&rsquo; mode and lets you edit positions locally. If you want to
edit positions on ICS in a way that other ICS users can see, use
the ICS <kbd>examine</kbd> command, or start an ICS match against yourself. 
(See also the ICS Client topic above.) 
<br><dt>Training<dd><a name="index-Training_002c-Menu-Item-36"></a>Training mode lets you interactively guess the moves of a game for one
of the players. You guess the next move of the game by playing the
move on the board. If the move played matches the next move of the
game, the move is accepted and the opponent's response is autoplayed. 
If the move played is incorrect, an error message is displayed.  You
can select this mode only while loading a game (that is, after
selecting &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Load Game</span></samp>&rsquo; from the File menu).  While XBoard is in
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Training</span></samp>&rsquo; mode, the navigation buttons are disabled. 
<br><dt>Show Game List<dd><a name="index-Show-Game-List_002c-Menu-Item-37"></a>Shows or hides the list of games generated by the last &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Load Game</span></samp>&rsquo;
command. 
<br><dt>Show Move History<dd><a name="index-Show-Move-History_002c-Menu-Item-38"></a>Shows or hides a list of moves of the current game. 
This list allows you to move the display to any earlier position in the game
by clicking on the corresponding move. 
<br><dt>Show Engine Output<dd><a name="index-Show-Engine-Output_002c-Menu-Item-39"></a>Shows or hides a window in which the thinking output of any loaded engines
is displayed. 
<br><dt>Edit Tags<dd><a name="index-Edit-Tags_002c-Menu-Item-40"></a>Lets you edit the PGN (portable game notation)
tags for the current game. After editing, the tags must still conform to
the PGN tag syntax:

     <pre class="example">          &lt;tag-section&gt; ::= &lt;tag-pair&gt; &lt;tag-section&gt;
                                  &lt;empty&gt;
          &lt;tag-pair&gt; ::= [ &lt;tag-name&gt; &lt;tag-value&gt; ]
          &lt;tag-name&gt; ::= &lt;identifier&gt;
          &lt;tag-value&gt; ::= &lt;string&gt;
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">See the PGN Standard for full details. Here is an example:

     <pre class="example">          [Event "Portoroz Interzonal"]
          [Site "Portoroz, Yugoslavia"]
          [Date "1958.08.16"]
          [Round "8"]
          [White "Robert J. Fischer"]
          [Black "Bent Larsen"]
          [Result "1-0"]
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Any characters that do not match this syntax are silently ignored. Note that
the PGN standard requires all games to have at least the seven tags shown
above. Any that you omit will be filled in by XBoard
with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo; (unknown value), or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; (inapplicable value). 
<br><dt>Edit Comment<dd><a name="index-Edit-Comment_002c-Menu-Item-41"></a>Adds or modifies a comment on the current position. Comments are
saved by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Save Game</span></samp>&rsquo; and are displayed by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Load Game</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Forward</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Backward</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
<br><dt>ICS Input Box<dd><a name="index-ICS-Input-Box_002c-Menu-Item-42"></a>If this option is set in ICS mode,
XBoard
creates an extra window that you can use for typing in ICS commands. 
The input box is especially useful if you want to type in something long or do
some editing on your input, because output from ICS doesn't get mixed
in with your typing as it would in the main terminal window. 
<br><dt>Pause<dd><a name="index-Pause_002c-Menu-Item-43"></a>Pauses updates to the board, and if you are playing against a chess engine,
also pauses your clock. To continue, select &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Pause</span></samp>&rsquo; again, and the
display will automatically update to the latest position. 
The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">P</span></samp>&rsquo; button and keyboard <kbd>p</kbd> key are equivalents.

     <p>If you select Pause when you are playing against a chess engine and
it is not your move, the chess engine's clock
will continue to run and it will eventually make a move, at which point
both clocks will stop. Since board updates are paused, however,
you will not see the move until you exit from Pause mode (or select Forward). 
This behavior is meant to simulate adjournment with a sealed move.

     <p>If you select Pause while you are observing or examining a game on a
chess server, you can step backward and forward in the current history
of the examined game without affecting the other observers and
examiners, and without having your display jump forward to the latest
position each time a move is made. Select Pause again to reconnect
yourself to the current state of the game on ICS.

     <p>If you select &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Pause</span></samp>&rsquo; while you are loading a game, the game stops
loading. You can load more moves manually by selecting &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Forward</span></samp>&rsquo;, or
resume automatic loading by selecting &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Pause</span></samp>&rsquo; again.

The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[&lt;]</span></samp>&rsquo; button and the <kbd>b</kbd> key are equivalents,
as is turning the mouse wheel towards you. 
In addition, pressing the Control key steps back one move, and releasing
it steps forward again.

     <p>In most modes, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Backward</span></samp>&rsquo; only lets you look back at old positions;
it does not retract moves. This is the case if you are playing against
a chess engine, playing or observing a game on an ICS, or loading a game. 
If you select &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Backward</span></samp>&rsquo; in any of these situations, you will not
be allowed to make a different move. Use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Retract Move</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Edit Game</span></samp>&rsquo; if you want to change past moves.

     <p>If you are examining an ICS game, the behavior of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Backward</span></samp>&rsquo;
depends on whether XBoard is in Pause mode. If Pause mode is
off, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Backward</span></samp>&rsquo; issues the ICS backward command, which backs up
everyone's view of the game and allows you to make a different
move. If Pause mode is on, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Backward</span></samp>&rsquo; only backs up your local
view. 
<br><dt>Forward<dd><a name="index-Forward_002c-Menu-Item-59"></a><a name="index-g_t_003e_002c-Button-60"></a>Steps forward through a series of remembered moves (undoing the
effect of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Backward</span></samp>&rsquo;) or forward through a game file. The
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[&gt;]</span></samp>&rsquo; button and the <kbd>f</kbd> key are equivalents,
as is turning the mouse wheel away from you.

     <p>If you are examining an ICS game, the behavior of Forward
depends on whether XBoard is in Pause mode. If Pause mode is
off, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Forward</span></samp>&rsquo; issues the ICS forward command, which moves
everyone's view of the game forward along the current line. If
Pause mode is on, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Forward</span></samp>&rsquo; only moves your local view forward,
and it will not go past the position that the game was in when
you paused. 
<br><dt>Back to Start<dd><a name="index-Back-to-Start_002c-Menu-Item-61"></a><a name="index-g_t_003c_003c_002c-Button-62"></a>Jumps backward to the first remembered position in the game. 
The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[&lt;&lt;]</span></samp>&rsquo; button and the shifted <kbd>B</kbd> key are equivalents.

     <p>In most modes, Back to Start only lets you look back at old
positions; it does not retract moves. This is the case if you
are playing against a local chess engine, playing or observing a game on
a chess server, or loading a game. If you select &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Back to Start</span></samp>&rsquo; in any
of these situations, you will not be allowed to make different
moves. Use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Retract Move</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Edit Game</span></samp>&rsquo; if you want to change past
moves; or use Reset to start a new game.

     <p>If you are examining an ICS game, the behavior of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Back to
Start</span></samp>&rsquo; depends on whether XBoard is in Pause mode. If Pause mode
is off, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Back to Start</span></samp>&rsquo; issues the ICS &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">backward 999999</span></samp>&rsquo;
command, which backs up everyone's view of the game to the start and
allows you to make different moves. If Pause mode is on, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Back
to Start</span></samp>&rsquo; only backs up your local view. 
<br><dt>Forward to End<dd><a name="index-Forward-to-End_002c-Menu-Item-63"></a><a name="index-g_t_003e_003e_002c-Button-64"></a>Jumps forward to the last remembered position in the game. The
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[&gt;&gt;]</span></samp>&rsquo; button and the shifted <kbd>F</kbd> key are equivalents.

     <p>If you are examining an ICS game, the behavior of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Forward to
End</span></samp>&rsquo; depends on whether XBoard is in Pause mode. If Pause mode
is off, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Forward to End</span></samp>&rsquo; issues the ICS &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">forward 999999</span></samp>&rsquo;
command, which moves everyone's view of the game forward to the end of
the current line. If Pause mode is on, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Forward to End</span></samp>&rsquo; only moves
your local view forward, and it will not go past the position
that the game was in when you paused. 
<br><dt>Revert<dd><a name="index-Revert_002c-Menu-Item-65"></a>If you are examining an ICS game and Pause mode is off, issues
the ICS command &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">revert</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
<br><dt>Truncate Game<dd><a name="index-Truncate-Game_002c-Menu-Item-66"></a>Discards all remembered moves of the game beyond the current

<br><dt>Retract Move<dd><a name="index-Retract-Move_002c-Menu-Item-68"></a>Retracts your last move. In chess engine mode, you can do this only
after the chess engine has replied to your move; if the chess engine is still
thinking, use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Move Now</span></samp>&rsquo; first. In ICS mode, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Retract Move</span></samp>&rsquo;
issues the command &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">takeback 1</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">takeback 2</span></samp>&rsquo;
depending on whether it is your opponent's move or yours.

     <dl>
<dt>Flip View<dd><a name="index-Flip-View_002c-Menu-Item-74"></a>Inverts your view of the chess board for the duration of the
current game. Starting a new game returns the board to normal. 
The <kbd>v</kbd> key is a keyboard equivalent. 
<br><dt>Adjudications<dd><a name="index-Adjudications_002c-Menu-Item-75"></a>Pops up a sub-menu where you can enable or disable various adjudications
that XBoard can perform in engine-engine games. 
You can instruct XBoard to detect and terminate the game on checkmate
or stalemate, even if the engines would not do so, to verify engine
result claims (forfeiting engines that make false claims), rather than
naively following the engine, to declare draw on posititions
which can never be won for lack of mating material, (e.g. KBK),
or which are impossble to win unless the opponent seeks its own demise
(e.g. KBKN). 
For these adjudications to work, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Test Legality</span></samp>&rsquo; should be switched on. 
It is also possible to insruct XBoard to enforce a 50-move or 3-fold-repeat
rule and automtically declare draw (after a user-adjustable number of moves
or repeats) even if the engines are prepared to go on. 
It is also possible to have XBoard declare draw on games that seem to drag on
forever, or adjudicate a loss if both engines agree (for 3 cosecutive moves) that one
of them is behind more than a user-adjustable score threshold. 
For the latter adjudication to work, XBoard should be able to properly understand
the engine's scores. To faclitate the latter, you can inform xboard here if
the engines report scores from the viewpoint of white, or from that of their own color. 
<br><dt>Engine Settings<dd>Pops up a sub-menu where you can set some engine parameters common to most engines,
such as hash-table size, tablebase cache size, maximum number of processors
that SMP engines can use, and where to find the Polyglot adapter needed
to run UCI engines under XBoard. The feature tht allows setting of these parameters on
engines is new since XBoard 4.3.15, so not many WinBoard engines respond
to it yet, but UCI engines should. 
It is also possible to specify a GUI opening book here, i.e. an opening
book that XBoard consults for any position a playing engine gets in. 
It then forces the engine to play the book move, rather than to think up its own,
if that position is found in the book. 
The book can switched on and off independently for either engine. 
<br><dt>Time Control<dd><a name="index-Time-Control_002c-Menu-Item-76"></a>Pops up a sub-menu where you can set the time-control parameters interactively. 
Allows you to select classical or incremental time controls,
set the moves per session, session duration, and time increment. 
Also allows specification of time-odds factors for one or both engines. 
If an engine is given a time-odds factor N, all time quota it gets,
be it at the beginning of a session or through the time increment or
fixed time per move, will be divided by N. 
<br><dt>Always Queen<dd><a name="index-Always-Queen_002c-Menu-Item-77"></a>If this option is off, XBoard brings up a dialog
box whenever you move a pawn to the last rank, asking what piece
you want to promote it to. If the option is true, your pawns are
always promoted to queens. Your opponent can still underpromote. 
<br><dt>Animate Dragging<dd><a name="index-Animate-Dragging_002c-Menu-Item-78"></a>If Animate Dragging is on, while you are dragging a piece with the
mouse, an image of the piece follows the mouse cursor. 
If Animate Dragging is off, there is no visual feedback while you are
dragging a piece, but if Animate Moving is on, the move will be
animated when it is complete. 
<br><dt>Animate Moving<dd><a name="index-Animate-Moving_002c-Menu-Item-79"></a>If Animate Moving is on, all piece moves are animated.  An image of the
piece is shown moving from the old square to the new square when the
move is completed (unless the move was already animated by Animate Dragging). 
If Animate Moving is off, a moved piece instantly disappears from its
old square and reappears on its new square when the move is complete. 
<br><dt>Auto Comment<dd><a name="index-Auto-Comment_002c-Menu-Item-80"></a>If this option is on, any remarks made on ICS while you are observing or
playing a game are recorded as a comment on the current move.  This includes
remarks made with the ICS commands <kbd>say</kbd>, <kbd>tell</kbd>, <kbd>whisper</kbd>,
and <kbd>kibitz</kbd>. 
Limitation: remarks that you type yourself are not recognized;
XBoard scans only the output from ICS, not the input you type to it. 
<br><dt>Auto Flag<dd><a name="index-Auto-Flag_002c-Menu-Item-81"></a>If this option is on and one player runs out of time
before the other,
XBoard
will automatically call his flag, claiming a win on time. 
In ICS mode, Auto Flag will only call your opponent's flag, not yours,
and the ICS may award you a draw instead of a win if you have
insufficient mating material.  In local chess engine mode,
XBoard
may call either player's flag and will not take material into account. 
<br><dt>Auto Flip View<dd><a name="index-Auto-Flip-View_002c-Menu-Item-82"></a>If the Auto Flip View option is on when you start a game, the board
will be automatically oriented so that your pawns move from the bottom
of the window towards the top. 
<br><dt>Auto Observe<dd><a name="index-Auto-Observe_002c-Menu-Item-83"></a>If this option is on and you add a player to your <code>gnotify</code>
list on ICS, XBoard will automatically observe all of that
player's games, unless you are doing something else (such as
observing or playing a game of your own) when one starts. 
The games are displayed
from the point of view of the player on your gnotify list; that is, his
pawns move from the bottom of the window towards the top. 
Exceptions:  If both players in a game are on your gnotify list, if
your ICS
<code>highlight</code>
variable is set to 0, or if the ICS you are using does not
properly support observing from Black's point of view,
you will see the game from White's point of view. 
<br><dt>Auto Raise Board<dd><a name="index-Auto-Raise-Board_002c-Menu-Item-84"></a>If this option is on, whenever a new game begins, the chessboard window
is deiconized (if necessary) and raised to the top of the stack of windows. 
<br><dt>Auto Save<dd><a name="index-Auto-Save_002c-Menu-Item-85"></a>If this option is true, at the end of every game XBoard prompts
you for a file name and appends a record of the game to the file
you specify. 
Disabled if the <code>saveGameFile</code> command-line
option is set, as in that case all games are saved to the specified file. 
See <a href="#Load-and-Save-options">Load and Save options</a>. 
<br><dt>Blindfold<dd><a name="index-Blindfold_002c-Menu-Item-86"></a>If this option is on, XBoard displays the board as usual but does
not display pieces or move highlights.  You can still move in the
usual way (with the mouse or by typing moves in ICS mode), even though
the pieces are invisible. 
<br><dt>Flash Moves<dd><a name="index-Flash-Moves_002c-Menu-Item-87"></a>If this option is on, whenever a move is completed, the moved piece flashes. 
The number of times to flash is set by the flashCount command-line
option; it defaults to 3 if Flash Moves is first turned on from the menu.

     <p>If you are playing a game on an ICS, the board is always
oriented at the start of the game so that your pawns move from
the bottom of the window towards the top. Otherwise, the starting
orientation is determined by the <code>flipView</code> command line option;
if it is false (the default), White's pawns move from bottom to top
at the start of each game; if it is true, Black's pawns move from
bottom to top. See <a href="#User-interface-options">User interface options</a>. 
<br><dt>Get Move List<dd><a name="index-Get-Move-List_002c-Menu-Item-88"></a>If this option is on, whenever XBoard
receives the first board of a new ICS game (or a different game from
the one it is currently displaying), it
retrieves the list of past moves from the ICS. 
You can then review the moves with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Forward</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Backward</span></samp>&rsquo;
commands
or save them with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Save Game</span></samp>&rsquo;.  You might want to
turn off this option if you are observing several blitz games at once,
to keep from wasting time and network bandwidth fetching the move lists over
and over. 
When you turn this option on from the menu, XBoard
immediately fetches the move list of the current game (if any). 
<br><dt>Highlight Last Move<dd><a name="index-Highlight-Last-Move_002c-Menu-Item-89"></a>If Highlight Last Move is on, after a move is made, the starting and
ending squares remain highlighted. In addition, after you use Backward
or Back to Start, the starting and ending squares of the last move to
be unmade are highlighted. 
<br><dt>Move Sound<dd><a name="index-Move-Sound_002c-Menu-Item-90"></a>If this option is on, XBoard alerts you by playing a sound
after each of your opponent's moves (or after every
move if you are observing a game on the Internet Chess Server). 
The sound is not played after moves you make or moves read from a
saved game file. By default, the
sound is the terminal bell, but on some systems you can change it
to a sound file using the soundMove option; see below.

     <p>If you turn on this option when using XBoard with the Internet
Chess Server, you will probably want to give the
<kbd>set bell 0</kbd>
command to the ICS, since otherwise the ICS will ring the terminal bell
after every move (not just yours). (The <samp><span class="file">.icsrc</span></samp> file
is a good place for this; see <a href="#ICS-options">ICS options</a>.) 
<br><dt>ICS Alarm<dd><a name="index-ICS-Alarm_002c-Menu-Item-91"></a>When this option is on, an alarm sound is played when your clock
counts down to the icsAlarmTime (by default, 5 seconds) in an ICS
game.  For games with time controls that include an increment, the
alarm will sound each time the clock counts down to the icsAlarmTime. 
By default, the alarm sound is the terminal bell, but on some systems
you can change it to a sound file using the soundIcsAlarm option; see
below. 
<br><dt>Old Save Style<dd><a name="index-Old-Save-Style_002c-Menu-Item-92"></a>If this option is off, XBoard saves games in PGN
(portable game notation) and positions in FEN (Forsythe-Edwards
notation).  If the option is on, a save style that is compatible
with older versions of XBoard is used instead. 
The old position style is more human-readable
than FEN; the old game style has no particular advantages. 
<br><dt>Periodic Updates<dd><a name="index-Periodic-Updates_002c-Menu-Item-93"></a>If this option is off (or if
you are using a chess engine that does not support periodic updates),
the analysis window
will only be updated when the analysis changes. If this option is
on, the Analysis Window will be updated every two seconds. 
<br><dt>Ponder Next Move<dd><a name="index-Ponder-Next-Move_002c-Menu-Item-94"></a>If this option is off, the chess engine will think only when it is on
move.  If the option is on, the engine will also think while waiting
for you to make your move. 
<br><dt>Popup Exit Message<dd><a name="index-Popup-Exit-Message_002c-Menu-Item-95"></a>If this option is on, when XBoard wants to display a message just
before exiting, it brings up a modal dialog box and waits for you to
click OK before exiting.  If the option is off, XBoard prints the
message to standard error (the terminal) and exits immediately. 
<br><dt>Popup Move Errors<dd><a name="index-Popup-Move-Errors_002c-Menu-Item-96"></a>If this option is off, when you make an error in moving (such as
attempting an illegal move or moving the wrong color piece), the
error message is displayed in the message area.  If the option is
on, move errors are displayed in small popup windows like other errors. 
You can dismiss an error popup either by clicking its OK button or by
clicking anywhere on the board, including downclicking to start a move. 
<br><dt>Premove<dd><a name="index-Premove_002c-Menu-Item-97"></a>If this option is on while playing a game on an ICS, you can register
your next planned move before it is your turn.  Move the piece with
the mouse in the ordinary way, and the starting and ending squares
will be highlighted with a special color (red by default).  When it is
your turn, if your registered move is legal, XBoard will send it to
ICS immediately; if not, it will be ignored and you can make a
different move.  If you change your mind about your premove, either
make a different move, or double-click on any piece to cancel the move
entirely. 
<br><dt>Quiet Play<dd><a name="index-Quiet-Play_002c-Menu-Item-98"></a>If this option is on, XBoard will automatically issue an ICS
<kbd>set shout 0</kbd>
command whenever you start a game and a
<kbd>set shout 1</kbd>
command whenever you finish one.  Thus, you will not be distracted
by shouts from other ICS users while playing. 
<br><dt>Show Coords<dd><a name="index-Show-Coords_002c-Menu-Item-99"></a>If this option is on, XBoard displays algebraic coordinates
along the board's left and bottom edges. 
<br><dt>Hide Thinking<dd><a name="index-Hide-Thinking_002c-Menu-Item-100"></a>If this option is off, the chess engine's notion of the score and best
line of play from the current position is displayed as it is
thinking. The score indicates how many pawns ahead (or if negative,
behind) the chess engine thinks it is. In matches between two
machines, the score is prefixed by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">W</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>&rsquo; to indicate
whether it is showing White's thinking or Black's, and only the thinking
of the engine that is on move is shown. 
<br><dt>Test Legality<dd><a name="index-Test-Legality_002c-Menu-Item-101"></a>If this option is on, XBoard tests whether the moves you try to make
with the mouse are legal and refuses to let you make an illegal move. 
Moves loaded from a file with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Load Game</span></samp>&rsquo; are also checked.  If
the option is off, all moves are accepted, but if a local chess engine
or the ICS is active, they will still reject illegal moves.  Turning
off this option is useful if you are playing a chess variant with
rules that XBoard does not understand.  (Bughouse, suicide, and wild
variants where the king may castle after starting on the d file are
generally supported with Test Legality on.)

feature to work, the file <samp><span class="file">xboard.6</span></samp> must have been installed by
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make install</span></samp>&rsquo; command when you built XBoard, and the

<br><dt>Book<dd><a name="index-Book_002c-Menu-Item-107"></a>Displays a list of possible moves from the chess engine's opening
book.  The exact format depends on what chess engine you are using. 
With GNU Chess 4, the first column gives moves, the second column
gives one possible response for each move, and the third column shows
the number of lines in the book that include the move from the first
column. If you select this option and nothing happens, the chess
engine is out of its book or does not support this feature.

<dt>Iconize<dd>Pressing the <kbd>i</kbd> or <kbd>c</kbd> key iconizes XBoard. The graphical
icon displays a white knight if it is White's move, or a black knight
if it is Black's move. If your X window manager displays only text
icons, not graphical ones, check its documentation; there is probably
a way to enable graphical icons.  If you get black and white reversed,
we would like to hear about it; see <a href="#Problems">Problems</a> below for
instructions on how to report this problem. 
</dl>

   <p>You can add or remove shortcut keys using the X resources
<code>form.translations</code>. Here is an example of what would go in your
<samp><span class="file">.Xresources</span></samp> file:

<pre class="example">     XBoard*form.translations: \
       Shift&lt;Key&gt;?: AboutGameProc() \n\
       &lt;Key&gt;y: AcceptProc() \n\
       &lt;Key&gt;n: DeclineProc() \n\
       &lt;Key&gt;i: NothingProc()
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Binding a key to <code>NothingProc</code> makes it do nothing, thus removing
it as a shortcut key. The XBoard commands that can be bound to keys
are:

<pre class="example">     AbortProc, AboutGameProc, AboutProc, AcceptProc, AdjournProc,

<h2 class="chapter">3 Options</h2>

<p><a name="index-Options-111"></a><a name="index-Options-112"></a>
This section documents the command-line options to XBoard.  You can
set these options in two ways: by typing them on the shell command
line you use to start XBoard, or by setting them as X resources
(typically in your <samp><span class="file">.Xresources</span></samp> file).  Many of the options
cannot be changed while XBoard is running; others set the initial
state of items that can be changed with the <a href="#Options">Options</a> menu.

   <p>Most of the options have both a long name and a short name. To turn a
boolean option on or off from the command line, either give its long
name followed by the value true or false
(&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-longOptionName true</span></samp>&rsquo;), or give just the short name to turn the
option on (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-opt</span></samp>&rsquo;), or the short name preceded by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; to
turn the option off (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-xopt</span></samp>&rsquo;). For options that take strings or
numbers as values, you can use the long or short option names
interchangeably.

   <p>Each option corresponds to an X resource with the same name, so
if you like, you can set options in your <samp><span class="file">.Xresources</span></samp> file
or in a file named <samp><span class="file">XBoard</span></samp> in your home directory. 
For options that have two names, the longer one is the name of
the corresponding X resource; the short name is not recognized. 
To turn a boolean option on or off as an
X resource, give its long name followed by the value
true or false (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">XBoard*longOptionName: true</span></samp>&rsquo;).

<h3 class="section">3.1 Chess Engine Options</h3>

<p><a name="index-options_002c-Chess-engine-113"></a><a name="index-Chess-engine-options-114"></a>
     <dl>
<dt>-tc or -timeControl minutes[:seconds]<dd><a name="index-tc_002c-option-115"></a><a name="index-timeControl_002c-option-116"></a>Each player begins with his clock set to the <code>timeControl</code> period. 
Default: 5 minutes. 
The additional options <code>movesPerSession</code> and <code>timeIncrement</code>
are mutually exclusive. 
<br><dt>-mps or -movesPerSession moves<dd><a name="index-mps_002c-option-117"></a><a name="index-movesPerSession_002c-option-118"></a>When both players have made <code>movesPerSession</code> moves, a
new <code>timeControl</code> period is added to both clocks.  Default: 40 moves. 
<br><dt>-inc or -timeIncrement seconds<dd><a name="index-inc_002c-option-119"></a><a name="index-timeIncrement_002c-option-120"></a>If this option is specified, <code>movesPerSession</code> is ignored. 
Instead, after each player's move, <code>timeIncrement</code> seconds are
added to his clock. 
Use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-inc 0</span></samp>&rsquo; if you want to require the entire
game to be played in one <code>timeControl</code> period, with no increment. 
Default: -1, which specifies <code>movesPerSession</code> mode. 
<br><dt>-clock/-xclock or -clockMode true/false<dd><a name="index-clock_002c-option-121"></a><a name="index-clockMode_002c-option-122"></a>Determines whether or not to display the chess clocks. If clockMode is
false, the clocks are not shown, but the side that is to play next
is still highlighted. Also, unless <code>searchTime</code>
is set, the chess engine still keeps track of the clock time and uses it to
determine how fast to make its moves. 
<br><dt>-st or -searchTime minutes[:seconds]<dd><a name="index-st_002c-option-123"></a><a name="index-searchTime_002c-option-124"></a>Tells the chess engine to spend at most the given amount of time
searching for each of its moves. Without this option, the chess engine
chooses its search time based on the number of moves and amount
of time remaining until the next time control. 
Setting this option also sets clockMode to false. 
<br><dt>-depth or -searchDepth number<dd><a name="index-sd_002c-option-125"></a><a name="index-searchDepth_002c-option-126"></a>Tells the chess engine to look ahead at most the given number of moves
when searching for a move to make. Without this option, the chess
engine chooses its search depth based on the number of moves and
amount of time remaining until the next time control.  With the option,
the engine will cut off its search early if it reaches the specified depth. 
<br><dt>-firstNPS number<dt>-secondNPS number<dd><a name="index-firstNPS_002c-option-127"></a><a name="index-secondNPS_002c-option-128"></a>Tells the chess engine to use an internal time standard based on its node count,
rather then wall-clock time, to make its timing decisions. 
The time in virtual seconds should be obtained by dividing the node count
through the given number, like the number was a rate in nodes per second. 
Xboard will manage the clocks in accordance with this, relying on the number
of nodes reported by the engine in its thinking output. If the given number equals zero,
it can obviously not be used to convert nodes to seconds, and the time reported
by the engine is used to decrement the XBoard clock in stead. The engine is supposed to
report in CPU time it uses, rather than wall-clock time, in this mode. This option
can provide fairer conditions for engine-engine matches on heavily loaded machines,
or with very fast games (where the wall clock is too inaccurate). 
<code>showThinking</code> must be on for this option to work. Default: -1 (off). 
Not many engines might support this yet! 
<br><dt>-firstTimeOdds factor<dt>-secondTimeOdds factor<dd><a name="index-firstTimeOdds_002c-option-129"></a><a name="index-secondTimeOdds_002c-option-130"></a>Reduces the time given to the mentioned engine by the given factor. 
If pondering is off, the effect is indistinguishable from what would happen
if the engine was running on an n-times slower machine. Default: 1. 
<br><dt>-timeOddsMode mode<dd><a name="index-timeOddsMode_002c-option-131"></a>This option determines how the case is handled where both engines have a time-odds handicap. 
If mode=1, the engine that gets the most time will always get the nominal time,
as specified by the time-control options, and its opponent's time is renormalized accordingly. 
If mode=0, both play with reduced time. Default: 0. 
<br><dt>-hideThinkingFromHuman true/false<dd>Controls the Hide Thinking option. See <a href="#Options-Menu">Options Menu</a>. Default: true. 
(Relaces the Show-Thinking option of older xboard versions.) 
<br><dt>-thinking/-xthinking or -showThinking true/false<dd><a name="index-thinking_002c-option-132"></a><a name="index-showThinking_002c-option-133"></a>Forces the engine to send thinking output to xboard. 
Used to be the only way to control if thinking output was displayed
in older xboard versions,
but as the thinking output in xboard 4.3 is also used for several other
purposes (adjudication, storing in PGN file) the display of it is now controlled
by the new option Hide Thinking. See <a href="#Options-Menu">Options Menu</a>. Default: false. 
(But if xboard needs the thinking output for some purpose,
it makes the engine send it despite the setting of this option.) 
<br><dt>-ponder/-xponder or -ponderNextMove true/false<dd><a name="index-ponder_002c-option-134"></a><a name="index-ponderNextMove_002c-option-135"></a>Sets the Ponder Next Move menu option. See <a href="#Options-Menu">Options Menu</a>. Default: true. 
<br><dt>-smpCores number<dd>Specifies the maxmum nmber of CPUs an SMP engine is allowed to use. 
Only works for engines that support the WinBoard-protocol cores feature. 
<br><dt>-mg or -matchGames n<dd><a name="index-mg_002c-option-136"></a><a name="index-matchGames_002c-option-137"></a>Automatically runs an n-game match between two chess engines,
with alternating colors. 
If the <code>loadGameFile</code> or <code>loadPositionFile</code> option is set,
XBoard
starts each game with the given opening moves or the given position;
otherwise, the games start with the standard initial chess position. 
If the <code>saveGameFile</code> option is set, a move record for the
match is appended to the specified file. If the <code>savePositionFile</code>
option is set, the final position reached in each game of the match is appended
to the specified file. When the match is over, XBoard
displays the match score and exits. Default: 0 (do not run a match). 
<br><dt>-mm/-xmm or -matchMode true/false<dd><a name="index-mm_002c-option-138"></a><a name="index-matchMode_002c-option-139"></a>Setting <code>matchMode</code> to true is equivalent to setting
<code>matchGames</code> to 1. 
<br><dt>-sameColorGames n<dd><a name="index-sameColorGames_002c-option-140"></a>Automatically runs an n-game match between two chess engines,
without alternating colors. 
Otherwise the same applies as for the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-matchGames</span></samp>&rsquo; option,
over which it takes precedence if both are specified. (See there.) 
Default: 0 (do not run a match). 
<br><dt>-fcp or -firstChessProgram program<dd><a name="index-fcp_002c-option-141"></a><a name="index-firstChessProgram_002c-option-142"></a>Name of first chess engine. 
Default: <samp><span class="file">Fairy-Max</span></samp>. 
<br><dt>-scp or -secondChessProgram program<dd><a name="index-scp_002c-option-143"></a><a name="index-secondChessProgram_002c-option-144"></a>Name of second chess engine, if needed. 
A second chess engine is started only in Two Machines (match) mode. 
Default: <samp><span class="file">Fairy-Max</span></samp>. 
<br><dt>-fb/-xfb or -firstPlaysBlack true/false<dd><a name="index-fb_002c-option-145"></a><a name="index-firstPlaysBlack_002c-option-146"></a>In games between two chess engines, firstChessProgram normally plays
white.  If this option is true, firstChessProgram plays black.  In a
multi-game match, this option affects the colors only for the first
game; they still alternate in subsequent games. 
<br><dt>-fh or -firstHost host<dt>-sh or -secondHost host<dd><a name="index-fh_002c-option-147"></a><a name="index-firstHost_002c-option-148"></a><a name="index-sh_002c-option-149"></a><a name="index-secondHost_002c-option-150"></a>Hosts on which the chess engines are to run. The default for
each is <samp><span class="file">localhost</span></samp>. If you specify another host, XBoard
uses <samp><span class="file">rsh</span></samp> to run the chess engine there. (You can substitute a
different remote shell program for rsh using the <code>remoteShell</code>
option described below.) 
<br><dt>-fd or -firstDirectory dir<dt>-sd or -secondDirectory dir<dd><a name="index-fd_002c-option-151"></a><a name="index-firstDirectory_002c-option-152"></a><a name="index-sd_002c-option-153"></a><a name="index-secondDirectory_002c-option-154"></a>Working directories in which the chess engines are to be run. 
The default is "", which means to run the chess engine
in the same working directory as XBoard
itself.  (See the CHESSDIR environment variable.) 
This option is effective only when the chess engine is being run
on the local host; it does not work if the engine is run remotely
using the -fh or -sh option. 
<br><dt>-initString string<dt>-secondInitString string<dd><a name="index-initString_002c-option-155"></a><a name="index-secondInitString_002c-option-156"></a>The string that is sent to initialize each chess engine for a new game. 
Default:

     <pre class="example">          new
          random
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Setting this option from the command line is tricky, because you must
type in real newline characters, including one at the very end. 
In most shells you can do this by
entering a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; character followed by a newline. It is easier to set
the option from your <samp><span class="file">.Xresources</span></samp> file; in that case you can
include the character sequence &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\n</span></samp>&rsquo; in the string, and it will
be converted to a newline.

     <p>If you change this option, don't remove the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">new</span></samp>&rsquo;
command; it is required by all chess engines to
start a new game.

     <p>You can remove the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">random</span></samp>&rsquo; command if you like; including it
causes GNU Chess 4 to randomize its move selection slightly so that it
doesn't play the same moves in every game.  Even without
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">random</span></samp>&rsquo;, GNU Chess 4 randomizes its choice of moves from its
opening book.  Many other chess engines ignore this command entirely
and always (or never) randomize.

     <p>You can also try adding other commands to the initString; see the
documentation of the chess engine you are using for details. 
<br><dt>-firstComputerString string<dt>-secondComputerString string<dd><a name="index-firstComputerString_002c-option-157"></a><a name="index-secondComputerString_002c-option-158"></a>The string that is sent to the chess engine if its opponent is another
computer chess engine.  The default is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">computer\n</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Probably the
only useful alternative is the empty string (&lsquo;<samp></samp>&rsquo;), which keeps the
engine from knowing that it is playing another computer. 
<br><dt>-reuse/-xreuse or -reuseFirst true/false<dt>-reuse2/-xreuse2 or -reuseSecond true/false<dd><a name="index-reuse_002c-option-159"></a><a name="index-reuseFirst_002c-option-160"></a><a name="index-reuse2_002c-option-161"></a><a name="index-reuseSecond_002c-option-162"></a>If the option is false,
XBoard kills off the chess engine after every game and starts
it again for the next game. 
If the option is true (the default),
XBoard starts the chess engine only once
and uses it repeatedly to play multiple games. 
Some old chess engines may not work properly when
reuse is turned on, but otherwise games will start faster if it is left on. 
<br><dt>-firstProtocolVersion version-number<dt>-secondProtocolVersion version-number<dd><a name="index-firstProtocolVersion_002c-option-163"></a><a name="index-secondProtocolVersion_002c-option-164"></a>This option specifies which version of the chess engine communication
protocol to use.  By default, version-number is 2.  In version 1, the
"protover" command is not sent to the engine; since version 1 is a
subset of version 2, nothing else changes.  Other values for
version-number are not supported. 
<br><dt>-firstScoreAbs true/false<dt>-secondScoreAbs true/false<dd><a name="index-firstScoreAbs_002c-option-165"></a><a name="index-secondScoreAbs_002c-option-166"></a>If this option is set, the score reported by the engine is taken to be
that in favor of white, even when the engine plays black. 
Important when XBoard uses the score for adjudications, or in PGN reporting. 
<br><dt>-niceEngines priority<dd><a name="index-niceEngines_002c-option-167"></a>This option allows you to lower the priority of the engine processes,
so that the generally insatiable hunger for CPU time of chess engines does not interfere so much
with smooth operation of WinBoard (or the rest of your system). 
Negative values could increase the engine priority, which is not recommended. 
<br><dt>-firstOptions string<dt>-secondOptions string<dd><a name="index-firstOptions_002c-option-168"></a><a name="index-secondOptions_002c-option-169"></a>The given string is a comma-separated list of (option name=option value) pairs,
like the following example: "style=Karpov,blunder rate=0". 
If the options announced by the engine at startup through the feature commands of WinBoard protocol
matches one of the option names (i.e. "style" or "blunder rate"),
it would be set to the given value (i.e. "Karpov" or 0)
through a corresponding option command to the engine. 
This provided that the type of the value (text or numeric) matches as well. 
<br><dt>-firstNeedsNoncompliantFEN string<dt>-secondNeedsNoncompliantFEN string<dd><a name="index-firstNeedsNoncompliantFEN_002c-option-170"></a><a name="index-secondNeedsNoncompliantFEN_002c-option-171"></a>The castling rights and e.p. fields of the FEN sent to the mentioned engine
with the setboard command will be replaced by the given string. This can for
instance be used to run engines that do not understand Chess960 FENs in
variant fischerandom, to make them at least understand the opening position,
through setting the string to "KQkq -". (Note you also have to give the e.p. field!) 
Other possible applications are to provide work-arounds for engines that want to see
castling and e.p. fields in variants that do not have castling or e.p. 
(shatranj, courier, xiangqi, shogi) so that WinBoard would normally omit them
(string = "- -"), or to add variant-specific fields that are not yet supported by WinBoard
(e.g. to indicate the number of checks in 3check).

<br><dt>-defaultPathEGTB filename<dd><a name="index-defaultPathEGTB_002c-option-189"></a>Gives the name of the directory where the end-game tablebases are installed, for UCI engines. 
Default: "/usr/local/share/egtb". 
<br><dt>-egtFormats string<dd><a name="index-egtFormats_002c-option-190"></a>Specifies which end-game tables are installed on the computer, and where. 
The argument is a comma-separated list of format specifications,
each specification consisting of a format name, a colon, and a directory path name,
e.g. "nalimov:/usr/local/share/egtb". 
If the name part matches that of a format that the engine requests through a feature command,
xboard will relay the path name for this format to the engine through an egtpath command. 
One egtpath command for each matching format will be sent. 
Popular formats are "nalimov" DTM tablebases and "scorpio" bitbases. 
Default: "".

<p><a name="index-ICS-options-191"></a><a name="index-Options_002c-ICS-192"></a>
     <dl>
<dt>-ics/-xics or -internetChessServerMode true/false<dd><a name="index-ics_002c-option-193"></a><a name="index-internetChessServerMode_002c-option-194"></a>Connect with an Internet Chess Server to play chess against its
other users, observe games they are playing, or review games
that have recently finished. Default: false. 
<br><dt>-icshost or -internetChessServerHost host<dd><a name="index-icshost_002c-option-195"></a><a name="index-internetChessServerHost_002c-option-196"></a>The Internet host name or address of the chess server to connect
to when in ICS mode. Default: <code>chessclub.com</code>. 
Another popular chess server to try is <code>freechess.org</code>. 
If your site doesn't have a working Internet name server, try
specifying the host address in numeric form. 
You may also need
to specify the numeric address when using the icshelper option
with timestamp or timeseal (see below). 
<br><dt>-icsport or -internetChessServerPort port-number<dd><a name="index-icsport_002c-option-197"></a><a name="index-internetChessServerPort_002c-option-198"></a>The port number to use when connecting to a chess server in ICS
mode. Default: 5000. 
<br><dt>-icshelper or -internetChessServerHelper prog-name<dd><a name="index-icshelper_002c-option-199"></a><a name="index-internetChessServerHelper_002c-option-200"></a>An external helper program used to communicate with the chess server. 
You would set it to "timestamp" for ICC (chessclub.com) or
"timeseal" for FICS (freechess.org), after
obtaining the correct version of timestamp or timeseal for your
computer.  See "help timestamp" on ICC and "help timeseal" on FICS. 
This option is shorthand for <code>-useTelnet -telnetProgram program</code>. 
<br><dt>-telnet/-xtelnet or -useTelnet true/false<dd><a name="index-telnet_002c-option-201"></a><a name="index-useTelnet_002c-option-202"></a>This option is poorly named; it should be called useHelper. 
If set to true, it instructs XBoard to run an external
program to communicate with the Internet Chess Server. 
The program to use is given by the telnetProgram option. 
If the option is
false (the default), XBoard opens a TCP socket and uses its own
internal implementation of the telnet protocol to communicate with the
ICS. See <a href="#Firewalls">Firewalls</a>. 
<br><dt>-telnetProgram prog-name<dd><a name="index-telnetProgram_002c-option-203"></a>This option is poorly named; it should be called helperProgram. 
It gives the name of the telnet program to be used with
the <code>gateway</code> and <code>useTelnet</code> options.  The default is
<samp><span class="file">telnet</span></samp>. The telnet program is invoked with the value of
<code>internetChessServerHost</code> as its first argument and the value
of <code>internetChessServerPort</code> as its second argument. 
See <a href="#Firewalls">Firewalls</a>. 
<br><dt>-gateway host-name<dd><a name="index-gateway_002c-option-204"></a>If this option is set to a host name, XBoard communicates with the
Internet Chess Server by using <samp><span class="file">rsh</span></samp> to run
the <code>telnetProgram</code> on the given host,
instead of using its own internal implementation
of the telnet protocol. You can substitute a different remote shell
program for <samp><span class="file">rsh</span></samp> using the <code>remoteShell</code> option described below. 
See <a href="#Firewalls">Firewalls</a>. 
<br><dt>-internetChessServerCommPort or -icscomm dev-name<dd><a name="index-internetChessServerCommPort_002c-option-205"></a><a name="index-icscomm_002c-option-206"></a>If this option is set, XBoard communicates with the ICS through
the given character I/O device instead of opening a TCP connection. 
Use this option if your system does not have any kind of
Internet connection itself (not even a SLIP or PPP connection),
but you do have dialup access (or a hardwired terminal line) to
an Internet service provider from which you can telnet to the ICS.

     <p>The support for this option in XBoard is minimal. You need to
set all communication parameters and tty modes before you enter
XBoard.

     <p>Use a script something like this:

     <pre class="example">          stty raw -echo 9600 &gt; /dev/tty00
          xboard -ics -icscomm /dev/tty00
</pre>
     <p>Here replace &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/dev/tty00</span></samp>&rsquo; with the name of the device that your
modem is connected to. You might have to add several more
options to these stty commands. See the man pages for <samp><span class="file">stty</span></samp>
and <code>tty</code> if you run into problems. Also, on many systems stty
works on its standard input instead of standard output, so you
have to use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;</span></samp>&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>If you are using linux, try starting with the script below. 
Change it as necessary for your installation.

     <pre class="example">          #!/bin/sh -f
          # configure modem and fire up XBoard
          
          # configure modem
          (
            stty 2400 ; stty raw ; stty hupcl ; stty -clocal
            stty ignbrk ; stty ignpar ; stty ixon ; stty ixoff
            stty -iexten ; stty -echo
          ) &lt; /dev/modem
          xboard -ics -icscomm /dev/modem
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">After you start XBoard in this way, type whatever commands are
necessary to dial out to your Internet provider and log in. 
Then telnet to ICS, using a command like
<kbd>telnet chessclub.com 5000</kbd>. 
Important: See the paragraph below about extra echoes,
in <a href="#Limitations">Limitations</a>. 
<br><dt>-icslogon or -internetChessServerLogonScript file-name<dd><a name="index-icslogon_002c-option-207"></a><a name="index-internetChessServerLogonScript_002c-option-208"></a><a name="index-g_t_002eicsrc-209"></a>Whenever XBoard connects to the Internet Chess Server,
if it finds a file with the name given in this option, it feeds the
file's contents to the ICS as commands. The default file name
is <samp><span class="file">.icsrc</span></samp>. 
Usually the first two lines of the file should be
your ICS user name and password. 
The file can be either in $CHESSDIR, in XBoard's working
directory if CHESSDIR is not set, or in your home directory. 
<br><dt>-msLoginDelay delay<dd><a name="index-msLoginDelay_002c-option-210"></a>If you experience trouble logging on to an ICS when using the
<code>-icslogon</code> option, inserting some delay between characters
of the logon script may help. This option adds <code>delay</code>
milliseconds of delay between characters. Good values to try
are 100 and 250. 
<br><dt>-icsinput/-xicsinput or -internetChessServerInputBox true/false<dd><a name="index-icsinput_002c-option-211"></a><a name="index-internetChessServerInputBox_002c-option-212"></a>Sets the ICS Input Box menu option. See <a href="#Mode-Menu">Mode Menu</a>. Default: false. 
<br><dt>-autocomm/-xautocomm or -autoComment true/false<dd><a name="index-autocomm_002c-option-213"></a><a name="index-autoComment_002c-option-214"></a>Sets the Auto Comment menu option. See <a href="#Options-Menu">Options Menu</a>. Default: false. 
<br><dt>-autoflag/-xautoflag or -autoCallFlag true/false<dd><a name="index-autoflag_002c-option-215"></a><a name="index-autoCallFlag_002c-option-216"></a>Sets the Auto Flag menu option.  See <a href="#Options-Menu">Options Menu</a>. Default: false. 
<br><dt>-autobs/-xautobs or -autoObserve true/false<dd><a name="index-autobs_002c-option-217"></a><a name="index-autoObserve_002c-option-218"></a>Sets the Auto Observe menu option.  See <a href="#Options-Menu">Options Menu</a>. Default: false. 
<br><dt>-autoKibitz<dd><a name="index-autoKibitz_002c-option-219"></a>Enables kibitzing of the engines last thinking output (depth, score, time, speed, PV)
before it moved
to the ICS, in zippy mode. The option <code>showThinking</code> must be switched on for
this option to work. 
Also diverts similar kibitz information of an opponent engine that is playing you
through the ICS to the engine-output window, as if the engine was playing locally. 
<br><dt>-moves/-xmoves or -getMoveList true/false<dd><a name="index-moves_002c-option-220"></a><a name="index-getMoveList_002c-option-221"></a>Sets the Get Move List menu option.  See <a href="#Options-Menu">Options Menu</a>.  Default: true. 
<br><dt>-alarm/-xalarm or -icsAlarm true/false<dd><a name="index-alarm_002c-option-222"></a><a name="index-icsAlarm_002c-option-223"></a>Sets the ICS Alarm menu option.  See <a href="#Options-Menu">Options Menu</a>. Default: true. 
<br><dt>-icsAlarmTime ms<dd><a name="index-icsAlarmTime_002c-option-224"></a>Sets the time in milliseconds for the ICS Alarm menu option. 
See <a href="#Options-Menu">Options Menu</a>. Default: 5000. 
<br><dt>lowTimeWarning true/false<dd><a name="index-lowTimeWarning_002c-option-225"></a>Controls a color change of the board as a warning your time is running out. 
See <a href="#Options-Menu">Options Menu</a>. Default: false. 
<br><dt>-pre/-xpre \fRor\fB -premove true/false<dd><a name="index-pre_002c-option-226"></a><a name="index-premove_002c-option-227"></a>Sets the Premove menu option. See <a href="#Options-Menu">Options Menu</a>. Default: true. 
<br><dt>-quiet/-xquiet or -quietPlay true/false<dd><a name="index-quiet_002c-option-228"></a><a name="index-quietPlay_002c-option-229"></a>Sets the Quiet Play menu option.  See <a href="#Options-Menu">Options Menu</a>.  Default: false. 
<br><dt>-colorizeMessages or -colorize<dd><a name="index-Colors-230"></a><a name="index-colorize_002c-option-231"></a>Setting colorizeMessages
to true tells XBoard to colorize the messages received from
the ICS.  Colorization works only if your xterm
supports ISO 6429 escape sequences for changing text colors. 
<br><dt>-colorShout foreground,background,bold<dt>-colorSShout foreground,background,bold<dt>-colorChannel1 foreground,background,bold<dt>-colorChannel foreground,background,bold<dt>-colorKibitz foreground,background,bold<dt>-colorTell foreground,background,bold<dt>-colorChallege foreground,background,bold<dt>-colorRequest foreground,background,bold<dt>-colorSeek foreground,background,bold<dt>-colorNormal foreground,background,bold<dd><a name="index-Colors-232"></a><a name="index-colorShout_002c-option-233"></a><a name="index-colorSShout_002c-option-234"></a><a name="index-colorChannel1_002c-option-235"></a><a name="index-colorChannel_002c-option-236"></a><a name="index-colorKibitz_002c-option-237"></a><a name="index-colorTell_002c-option-238"></a><a name="index-colorChallenge_002c-option-239"></a><a name="index-colorRequest_002c-option-240"></a><a name="index-colorSeek_002c-option-241"></a><a name="index-colorNormal_002c-option-242"></a>These options set the colors used when colorizing ICS messages. 
All ICS messages are grouped into one of these categories:
shout, sshout, channel 1, other channel, kibitz, tell, challenge,
request (including abort, adjourn, draw, pause, and takeback), or
normal (all other messages).

     <p>Each foreground or background argument can be one of the following:
black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white, or default. 
Here &ldquo;default&rdquo; means the default foreground or background color of
your xterm.  Bold can be 1 or 0.  If background is omitted, &ldquo;default&rdquo;
is assumed; if bold is omitted, 0 is assumed.

     <p>Here is an example of how to set the colors in your <samp><span class="file">.Xresources</span></samp> file. 
The colors shown here are the default values; you will get
them if you turn <code>-colorize</code> on without specifying your own colors.

     <pre class="example">          xboard*colorizeMessages: true
          xboard*colorShout: green
          xboard*colorSShout: green, black, 1
          xboard*colorChannel1: cyan
          xboard*colorChannel: cyan, black, 1
          xboard*colorKibitz: magenta, black, 1
          xboard*colorTell: yellow, black, 1
          xboard*colorChallenge: red, black, 1
          xboard*colorRequest: red
          xboard*colorSeek: blue
          xboard*colorNormal: default
</pre>
     <br><dt>-soundProgram progname<dd><a name="index-soundProgram_002c-option-243"></a><a name="index-Sounds-244"></a>If this option is set to a sound-playing program that is installed and
working on your system, XBoard can play sound files when certain
events occur, listed below.  The default program name is "play".  If
any of the sound options is set to "$", the event rings the terminal
bell by sending a ^G character to standard output, instead of playing
a sound file.  If an option is set to the empty string "", no sound is
played for that event. 
<br><dt>-soundShout filename<dt>-soundSShout filename<dt>-soundChannel filename<dt>-soundKibitz filename<dt>-soundTell filename<dt>-soundChallenge filename<dt>-soundRequest filename<dt>-soundSeek filename<dd><a name="index-soundShout_002c-option-245"></a><a name="index-soundSShout_002c-option-246"></a><a name="index-soundChannel_002c-option-247"></a><a name="index-soundKibitz_002c-option-248"></a><a name="index-soundTell_002c-option-249"></a><a name="index-soundChallenge_002c-option-250"></a><a name="index-soundRequest_002c-option-251"></a><a name="index-soundSeek_002c-option-252"></a>These sounds are triggered in the same way as the colorization events
described above.  They all default to "", no sound.  They are played
only if the colorizeMessages is on. 
<br><dt>-soundMove filename<dd><a name="index-soundMove_002c-option-253"></a>This sound is used by the Move Sound menu option.  Default: "$". 
<br><dt>-soundIcsAlarm filename<dd><a name="index-soundIcsAlarm_002c-option-254"></a>This sound is used by the ICS Alarm menu option.  Default: "$". 
<br><dt>-soundIcsWin filename<dd><a name="index-soundIcsWin_002c-option-255"></a>This sound is played when you win an ICS game.  Default: "" (no sound). 
<br><dt>-soundIcsLoss filename<dd><a name="index-soundIcsLoss_002c-option-256"></a>This sound is played when you lose an ICS game.  Default: "" (no sound). 
<br><dt>-soundIcsDraw filename<dd><a name="index-soundIcsDraw_002c-option-257"></a>This sound is played when you draw an ICS game.  Default: "" (no sound). 
<br><dt>-soundIcsUnfinished filename<dd><a name="index-soundIcsUnfinished_002c-option-258"></a>This sound is played when an ICS game that you are participating in is
aborted, adjourned, or otherwise ends inconclusively.  Default: "" (no

game file at startup. The file name <samp><span class="file">-</span></samp> specifies the standard
input. If there is more than one game in the file, XBoard
pops up a menu of the available games, with entries based on their PGN
(Portable Game Notation) tags. 
If the <code>loadGameIndex</code> option is set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">N</span></samp>&rsquo;, the menu is suppressed
and the N th game found in the file is loaded immediately. 
The menu is also suppressed if <code>matchMode</code> is enabled or if the game file
is a pipe; in these cases the first game in the file is loaded immediately. 
Use the <samp><span class="file">pxboard</span></samp> shell script provided with XBoard if you
want to pipe in files containing multiple games and still see the menu. 
If the loadGameIndex specifies an index -1, this triggers auto-increment
of the index in <code>matchMode</code>, which means that after every game the
index is incremented by one, causing each game of the match to be played
from the next game in the file. Similarly, specifying an index value of -2
causes the index to be incremented every two games, so that each game
in the file is used twice (with reversed colors). 
The <code>rewindIndex</code> option causes the index to be reset to the
first game of the file when it has reached a specified value. 
<br><dt>-rewindIndex n<dd>Causes a position file or game file to be rewound to its beginning after n
positions or games in auto-increment <code>matchMode</code>.

the Nth position found in the file is loaded; otherwise the
first position is loaded. 
If the loadPositionIndex specifies an index -1, this triggers auto-increment
of the index in <code>matchMode</code>, which means that after every game the
index is incremented by one, causing each game of the match to be played
from the next position in the file. Similarly, specifying an index value of -2
causes the index to be incremented every two games, so that each position
in the file is used twice (with the engines playing opposite colors). 
The <code>rewindIndex</code> option causes the index to be reset to the
first position of the file when it has reached a specified value. 
<br><dt>-spf or -savePositionFile file<dd><a name="index-spf_002c-option-275"></a><a name="index-savePositionFile_002c-option-276"></a>If this option is set, XBoard appends the final position reached

of the pieces and setting a few related parameters. 
The sizeName can be one of: Titanic, giving 129x129 pixel pieces,
Colossal 116x116, Giant 108x108, Huge 95x95, Big 87x87, Large 80x80, Bulky 72x72,
Medium 64x64, Moderate 58x58, Average 54x54, Middling 49x49, Mediocre
45x45, Small 40x40, Slim 37x37, Petite 33x33, Dinky 29x29, Teeny 25x25,
or Tiny 21x21. 
Pieces of all these sizes are built into XBoard. 
Other sizes can
be used if you have them; see the pixmapDirectory and bitmapDirectory
options. 
The default depends on the size of your screen; it is approximately the
largest size that will fit without clipping.

     <p>You can select other sizes or vary other layout parameters by providing
a list of comma-separated values (with no spaces) as the argument. 
You do not need to provide all the values; for any you omit from the
end of the list, defaults are taken from the nearest built-in size. 
The value <code>n1</code> gives the piece size, <code>n2</code> the width of the
black border
between squares, <code>n3</code> the desired size for the
clockFont, <code>n4</code> the desired size for the coordFont,
<code>n5</code> the desired size for the default font,
<code>n6</code> the smallLayout flag (0 or 1),
and <code>n7</code> the tinyLayout flag (0 or 1). 
All dimensions are in pixels. 
If the border between squares is eliminated (0 width), the various
highlight options will not work, as there is nowhere to draw the highlight. 
If smallLayout is 1 and <code>titleInWindow</code> is true,
the window layout is rearranged to make more room for the title. 
If tinyLayout is 1, the labels on the menu bar are abbreviated
to one character each and the buttons in the button bar are made narrower. 
<br><dt>-coords/-xcoords or -showCoords true/false<dd><a name="index-coords_002c-option-303"></a><a name="index-showCoords_002c-option-304"></a>Sets the Show Coords menu option.  See <a href="#Options-Menu">Options Menu</a>.  Default: false. 
The <code>coordFont</code> option specifies what font to use. 
<br><dt>-autoraise/-xautoraise or -autoRaiseBoard true/false<dd><a name="index-autoraise_002c-option-305"></a><a name="index-autoRaiseBoard_002c-option-306"></a>Sets the Auto Raise Board menu option.  See <a href="#Options-Menu">Options Menu</a>.  Default: true. 
<br><dt>-autoflip/-xautoflip or -autoFlipView true/false<dd><a name="index-autoflip_002c-option-307"></a><a name="index-autoFlipView_002c-option-308"></a>Sets the Auto Flip View menu option.  See <a href="#Options-Menu">Options Menu</a>.  Default: true. 
<br><dt>-flip/-xflip or -flipView true/false<dd><a name="index-flip_002c-option-309"></a><a name="index-flipView_002c-option-310"></a>If Auto Flip View is not set, or if you are observing but not participating
in a game, then the positioning of the board at the start of each game
depends on the flipView option.  If flipView is false (the default),
the board is positioned so that the white pawns move from the bottom to the
top; if true, the black pawns move from the bottom to the top. 
In any case, the Flip menu option (see <a href="#Options-Menu">Options Menu</a>)
can be used to flip the board after
the game starts. 
<br><dt>-title/-xtitle or -titleInWindow true/false<dd><a name="index-title_002c-option-311"></a><a name="index-titleInWindow_002c-option-312"></a>If this option is true, XBoard displays player names (for ICS
games) and game file names (for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Load Game</span></samp>&rsquo;) inside its main
window. If the option is false (the default), this information is
displayed only in the window banner. You probably won't want to
set this option unless the information is not showing up in the
banner, as happens with a few X window managers. 
<br><dt>-buttons/-xbuttons or -showButtonBar True/False<dd><a name="index-buttons_002c-option-313"></a><a name="index-showButtonBar_002c-option-314"></a>If this option is False, xboard omits the [&lt;&lt;] [&lt;] [P] [&gt;] [&gt;&gt;] button
bar from the window, allowing the message line to be wider.  You can
still get the functions of these buttons using the menus or their keyboard
shortcuts.  Default: true. 
<br><dt>-mono/-xmono or -monoMode true/false<dd><a name="index-mono_002c-option-315"></a><a name="index-monoMode_002c-option-316"></a>Determines whether XBoard displays its pieces and squares with
two colors (true) or four (false). You shouldn't have to
specify <code>monoMode</code>; XBoard will determine if it is necessary. 
<br><dt>-flashCount count<dt>-flashRate rate<dt>-flash/-xflash<dd><a name="index-flashCount_002c-option-317"></a><a name="index-flashRate_002c-option-318"></a><a name="index-flash_002c-option-319"></a><a name="index-xflash_002c-option-320"></a>These options enable flashing of pieces when they
land on their destination square. 
<code>flashCount</code>
tells XBoard how many times to flash a piece after it
lands on its destination square. 
<code>flashRate</code>
controls the rate of flashing (flashes/sec). 
Abbreviations:
<code>flash</code>
sets flashCount to 3. 
<code>xflash</code>
sets flashCount to 0. 
Defaults:  flashCount=0 (no flashing), flashRate=5. 
<br><dt>-highlight/-xhighlight or -highlightLastMove true/false<dd><a name="index-highlight_002c-option-321"></a><a name="index-highlightLastMove_002c-option-322"></a>Sets the Highlight Last Move menu option. See <a href="#Options-Menu">Options Menu</a>. Default: false. 
<br><dt>-blind/-xblind or -blindfold true/false<dd><a name="index-blind_002c-option-323"></a><a name="index-blindfold_002c-option-324"></a>Sets the Blindfold menu option.  See <a href="#Options-Menu">Options Menu</a>.  Default: false. 
<br><dt>-clockFont font<dd><a name="index-clockFont_002c-option-325"></a><a name="index-Font_002c-clock-326"></a>The font used for the clocks. If the option value is a pattern
that does not specify the font size, XBoard tries to choose an
appropriate font for the board size being used. 
Default: -*-helvetica-bold-r-normal&ndash;*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*. 
<br><dt>-coordFont font<dd><a name="index-coordFont_002c-option-327"></a><a name="index-Font_002c-coordinates-328"></a>The font used for rank and file coordinate labels if <code>showCoords</code>
is true. If the option value is a pattern that does not specify
the font size, XBoard tries to choose an appropriate font for
the board size being used. 
Default: -*-helvetica-bold-r-normal&ndash;*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*. 
<br><dt>-font font<dd><a name="index-font_002c-option-329"></a><a name="index-Font-330"></a>The font used for popup dialogs, menus, comments, etc. 
If the option value is a pattern that does not specify
the font size, XBoard tries to choose an appropriate font for
the board size being used. 
Default: -*-helvetica-medium-r-normal&ndash;*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*. 
<br><dt>-fontSizeTolerance tol<dd><a name="index-fontSizeTolerance_002c-option-331"></a>In the font selection algorithm, a nonscalable font will be preferred
over a scalable font if the nonscalable font's size differs
by <code>tol</code> pixels
or less from the desired size.  A value of -1 will force
a scalable font to always be used if available; a value of 0 will
use a nonscalable font only if it is exactly the right size;
a large value (say 1000) will force a nonscalable font to always be
used if available.  Default: 4. 
<br><dt>-bm or -bitmapDirectory dir<dt>-pixmap or -pixmapDirectory dir<dd><a name="index-bm_002c-option-332"></a><a name="index-bitmapDirectory_002c-option-333"></a><a name="index-pixmap_002c-option-334"></a><a name="index-pixmapDirectory_002c-option-335"></a>These options control what piece images xboard uses.  The XBoard
distribution includes one set of pixmap pieces in xpm format, in the
directory <samp><span class="file">pixmaps</span></samp>, and one set of bitmap pieces in xbm format,
in the directory <samp><span class="file">bitmaps</span></samp>.  Pixmap
pieces give a better appearance on the screen: the white pieces have
dark borders, and the black pieces have opaque internal details.  With
bitmaps, neither piece color has a border, and the internal details
are transparent; you see the square color or other background color
through them.

     <p>If XBoard is configured and compiled on a system that includes libXpm,
the X pixmap library, the xpm pixmap pieces are compiled in as the
default.  A different xpm piece set can be selected at runtime with
the <code>pixmapDirectory</code> option, or a bitmap piece set can be selected
with the <code>bitmapDirectory</code> option.

     <p>If XBoard is configured and compiled on a system that does not include
libXpm (or the <code>--disable-xpm</code> option is given to the configure
program), the bitmap pieces are compiled in as the default.  It is not
possible to use xpm pieces in this case, but pixmap pieces in another
format called "xim" can be used by giving the <code>pixmapDirectory</code> option. 
Or again, a different bitmap piece set can be selected with the
<code>bitmapDirectory</code> option.

     <p>Files in the <code>bitmapDirectory</code> must be named as follows:
The first character of a piece bitmap name gives the piece it
represents (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">q</span></samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">k</span></samp>&rsquo;),
the next characters give the size in pixels, the
following character indicates whether the piece is
solid or outline (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">o</span></samp>&rsquo;),
and the extension is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.bm</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
For example, a solid 80x80 knight would be named <samp><span class="file">n80s.bm</span></samp>. 
The outline bitmaps are used only in monochrome mode. 
If bitmap pieces are compiled in and the bitmapDirectory is missing
some files, the compiled in pieces are used instead.

     <p>If the bitmapDirectory option is given,
it is also possible to replace xboard's icons and menu checkmark,
by supplying files named <samp><span class="file">icon_white.bm</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">icon_black.bm</span></samp>, and
<samp><span class="file">checkmark.bm</span></samp>.

<dt>-adjudicateLossThreshold n<dd><a name="index-adjudicateLossThreshold_002c-option-349"></a>If the given value is non-zero, XBoard adjudicates the game as a loss
if both engines agree for a duration of 6 consecutive ply that the score
is below the given score threshold for that engine. Make sure the score
is interpreted properly by XBoard,
using <code>-firstScoreAbs</code> and <code>-secondScoreAbs</code> if needed. 
Default: 0 (no adjudiction)
<br><dt>-adjudicateDrawMoves n<dd><a name="index-adjudicateDrawMoves_002c-option-350"></a>If the given value is non-zero, XBoard adjudicates the game as a draw
if after the given number of moves it was not yet decided. Defaut: 0 (no adjudication)
<br><dt>-checkMates true/false<dd><a name="index-checkMates_002c-option-351"></a>If this option is set, XBoard detects all checkmates and stalemates,
and ends the game as soon as they occur. 
Legality-testing must be switched on for this option to work. 
Default: true
<br><dt>-testClaims true/false<dd><a name="index-testClaims_002c-option-352"></a>If this option is set, XBoard verifies all result claims made by engines,
and those who send false claims will forfeit the game because of it. 
Legality-testing must be switched on for this option to work. Default: true
<br><dt>-materialDraws true/false<dd><a name="index-materialDraws_002c-option-353"></a>If this option is set, XBoard adjudicates games as draws when there is
no sufficient material left to inflict a checkmate. 
This applies to KBKB with like bishops (any number, actually), and to KBK, KNK and KK. 
Legality-testing must be switched on for this option to work. Default: true
<br><dt>-trivialDraws true/false<dd><a name="index-trivialDraws_002c-option-354"></a>If this option is set, XBoard adjudicates games as draws that cannot be
usually won without opponent cooperation. This applies to KBKB with unlike bishops,
and to KBKN, KNKN, KNNK, KRKR and KQKQ. The draw is called after 6 ply into these end-games,
to allow quick mates that can occur in some exceptional positions to be found by the engines. 
KQKQ does not really belong in this category, and might be taken out in the future. 
(When bitbase-based adjudications are implemented.) 
Legality-testing must be on for this option to work. Default: false
<br><dt>-ruleMoves n<dd><a name="index-ruleMoves_002c-option-355"></a>If the given value is non-zero, XBoard adjudicates the game as a draw after the given
number of consecutive reversible moves. Engine draw claims are always accepted after 50 moves,
irrespective of the given value of n. 
<br><dt>-repeatsToDraw n<dd>If the given value is non-zero, xboard adjudicates the game as a draw if a position
is repeated the given number of times. Engines draw claims are always accepted after 3 repeats,
(on the 3rd occurrence, actually), irrespective of the value of n. 
Beware that positions that have different castling or en-passant rights do not count
as repeats, XBoard is fully e.p. and castling aware!

</pre>
     <p>In the shuffle variants, XBoard now does shuffle the pieces, although
you can still do it by hand using Edit Position.  Some variants are
supported only in ICS mode, including bughouse, and
kriegspiel.  The winning/drawing conditions in crazyhouse (offboard
interposition on mate), losers, suicide, giveaway, atomic, and 3check
are not fully understood. 
Berolina and cylinder chess can only be played with legality testing off. 
In crazyhouse, XBoard now does keep
track of offboard pieces.  In shatranj it does implement the baring
rule when mate detection is switched on. 
<br><dt>-boardHeight N<dd><a name="index-boardHeight_002c-option-362"></a>Allows you to set a non-standard number of board ranks in any variant. 
If the height is given as -1, the default height for the variant is used. 
Default: -1
<br><dt>-boardWidth N<dd><a name="index-boardWidth_002c-option-363"></a>Allows you to set a non-standard number of board files in any variant. 
If the width is given as -1, the default width for the variant is used. 
With a non-standard width, the initial position will always be an empty board,
as the usual opening array will not fit. 
Default: -1
<br><dt>-holdingsSize N<dd><a name="index-holdingsSize_002c-option-364"></a>Allows you to set a non-standard size for the holdings in any variant. 
If the size is given as -1, the default holdings size for the variant is used. 
The first N piece types will go into the holdings on capture, and you will be
able to drop them on the board in stead of making a normal move. If size equals 0,
there will be no holdings. 
Default: -1
<br><dt>-defaultFrcPosition N<dd><a name="index-defaultFrcPosition_002c-option-365"></a>Specifies the number of the opening position in shuffle games like Chess960. 
A value of -1 means the position is randomly generated by XBoard
at the beginning of every game. 
Default: -1
<br><dt>-pieceToSquareTable string<dd><a name="index-pieceToSquareTable_002c-option-366"></a>The characters that are used to represent the piece types XBoard knows in FEN
diagrams and SAN moves. The string argument has to have an even length
(or it will be ignored), as white and black pieces have to be given separately
(in that order). The last letter for each color will be the King. 
The letters before that will be PNBRQ and then a whole host of fairy pieces
in an order that has not fully crystallized yet (currently FEACWMOHIJGDVSLU,
F=Ferz, Elephant, A=Archbishop, C=Chancellor, W=Wazir, M=Commoner, O=Cannon,
H=Nightrider). You should list at least all pieces that occur in the variant
you are playing. If you have less than 44 characters in the string, the pieces
not mentioned will get assigned a period, and you will not be able to distinguish
them in FENs. You can also explicitly assign pieces a period, in which case they
will not be counted in deciding which captured pieces can go into the holdings. 
A tilde '~' as a piece name does mean this piece is used to represent a promoted
Pawn in crazyhouse-like games, i.e. on capture it turns back onto a Pawn. 
A '+' similarly indicates the piece is a shogi-style promoted piece, that should
revert to its non-promoted version on capture (rather than to a Pawn). 
Note that promoted pieces are represented by pieces 11 further in the list. 
You should not have to use this option often: each variant has its own default
setting for the piece representation in FEN, which should be sufficient in normal use. 
Default: ""
<br><dt>-debug/-xdebug or -debugMode true/false<dd><a name="index-debug_002c-option-367"></a><a name="index-debugMode_002c-option-368"></a>Turns on debugging printout. 
<br><dt>-debugFile filename or -nameOfDebugFile filename<dd><a name="index-debugFile_002c-option-369"></a><a name="index-nameOfDebugFile_002c-option-370"></a>Sets the name of the file to which WinBoard saves debug information
(including all communication to and from the engines). 
<br><dt>-engineDebugOutput number<dd><a name="index-engineDebugOutput_002c-option-371"></a>Specifies how WinBoard should handle unsolicited output from the engine,
with respect to saving it in the debug file. 
The output is further (hopefully) ignored. 
If number=0, WinBoard refrains from writing such spurious output to the debug file. 
If number=1, all engine output is written faithfully to the debug file. 
If number=2, any protocol-violating line is prefixed with a # character,
as the engine itself should have done if it wanted to submit info for inclusion in the debug file. 
This option is provided for the benefit of applications that use the debug file
as a source of information, such as the broadcaster of live games TLCV / TLCS. 
Such applications can be protected from spurious engine output that might otherwise confuse them. 
<br><dt>-rsh or -remoteShell shell-name<dd><a name="index-rsh_002c-option-372"></a><a name="index-remoteShell_002c-option-373"></a>Name of the command used to run programs remotely. The default

<h2 class="chapter">4 Chess Servers</h2>

<p><a name="index-ICS-379"></a><a name="index-ICS_002c-addresses-380"></a><a name="index-Internet-Chess-Server-381"></a>An <dfn>Internet Chess Server</dfn>, or <dfn>ICS</dfn>, is a place on the
Internet where people can get together to play chess, watch other
people's games, or just chat.  You can use either <code>telnet</code> or a
client program like XBoard to connect to the server.  There are
thousands of registered users on the different ICS hosts, and it is
not unusual to meet 200 on both chessclub.com and freechess.org.

   <p>Most people can just type <kbd>xboard -ics</kbd> to start XBoard as an ICS
client.  Invoking XBoard in this way connects you to the Internet
Chess Club (ICC), a commercial ICS.  You can log in there as a guest
even if you do not have a paid account.  To connect to the largest
Free ICS (FICS), use the command <kbd>xboard -ics -icshost freechess.org</kbd>
instead, or substitute a different host name to connect to your
favorite ICS. 
For a full description of command-line options that control
the connection to ICS and change the default values of ICS options, see
<a href="#ICS-options">ICS options</a>.

   <p>While you are running XBoard as an ICS client,
you use the terminal window that you started XBoard from
as a place to type in commands and read information that is
not available on the chessboard.

   <p>The first time you need to use the terminal is to enter your login name
and password, if you are a registered player. (You don't need to do
this manually; the <code>icsLogon</code> option can do it for you. 
see <a href="#ICS-options">ICS options</a>.)  If you are not registered,
enter <kbd>g</kbd> as your name, and the server will pick a
unique guest name for you.

   <p>Some useful ICS commands
include
     <dl>
<dt><kbd>help &lt;topic&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-help_002c-ICS-command-382"></a>to get help on the given &lt;topic&gt;. To get a list of possible topics type
<dfn>help</dfn> without topic.  Try the help command before you ask other
people on the server for help.

     <p>For example <kbd>help register</kbd> tells you how to become a registered
ICS player. 
<br><dt><kbd>who &lt;flags&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-who_002c-ICS-command-383"></a>to see a list of people who are logged on.  Administrators
(people you should talk to if you have a problem) are marked
with the character &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;, an asterisk. The &lt;flags&gt; allow you to
display only selected players: For example, <kbd>who of</kbd> shows a
list of players who are interested in playing but do not have
an opponent. 
<br><dt><kbd>games</kbd><dd><a name="index-games_002c-ICS-command-384"></a>to see what games are being played
<br><dt><kbd>match &lt;player&gt; [&lt;mins&gt;] [&lt;inc&gt;]</kbd><dd>to challenge another player to a game. Both opponents get &lt;mins&gt; minutes
for the game, and &lt;inc&gt; seconds will be added after each move. 
If another player challenges you, the server asks if you want to
accept the challenge; use the <kbd>accept</kbd> or <kbd>decline</kbd> commands
to answer. 
<br><dt><kbd>accept</kbd><dt><kbd>decline</kbd><dd><a name="index-accept_002c-ICS-command-385"></a><a name="index-decline_002c-ICS-command-386"></a>to accept or decline another player's offer. 
The offer may be to start a new game, or to agree to a
<kbd>draw</kbd>, <kbd>adjourn</kbd> or <kbd>abort</kbd> the current game. See <a href="#Action-Menu">Action Menu</a>.

     <p>If you have more than one pending offer (for example, if more than one player
is challenging you, or if your opponent offers both a draw and to adjourn the
game), you have to supply additional information, by typing something
like <kbd>accept &lt;player&gt;</kbd>, <kbd>accept draw</kbd>, or <kbd>draw</kbd>. 
<br><dt><kbd>draw</kbd><dt><kbd>adjourn</kbd><dt><kbd>abort</kbd><dd><a name="index-draw_002c-ICS-command-387"></a><a name="index-adjourn_002c-ICS-command-388"></a><a name="index-abort_002c-ICS-command-389"></a>asks your opponent to terminate a game by mutual agreement. Adjourned
games can be continued later. 
Your opponent can either <kbd>decline</kbd> your offer or accept it (by typing the
same command or typing <kbd>accept</kbd>).  In some cases these commands work
immediately, without asking your opponent to agree.  For example, you can
abort the game unilaterally if your opponent is out of time, and you can claim
a draw by repetition or the 50-move rule if available simply by typing
<kbd>draw</kbd>. 
<br><dt><kbd>finger &lt;player&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-finger_002c-ICS-command-390"></a>to get information about the given &lt;player&gt;. (Default: yourself.) 
<br><dt><kbd>vars</kbd><dd><a name="index-vars_002c-ICS-command-391"></a>to get a list of personal settings
<br><dt><kbd>set &lt;var&gt; &lt;value&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-set_002c-ICS-command-392"></a>to modify these settings
<br><dt><kbd>observe &lt;player&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-observe_002c-ICS-command-393"></a>to observe an ongoing game of the given &lt;player&gt;. 
<br><dt><kbd>examine</kbd><dt><kbd>oldmoves</kbd><dd><a name="index-examine_002c-ICS-command-394"></a><a name="index-oldmoves_002c-ICS-command-395"></a>to review a recently completed game

<h2 class="chapter">5 Firewalls</h2>

<p>By default, XBoard communicates with an Internet Chess Server
by opening a TCP socket directly from the machine it is running on
to the ICS. If there is a firewall between your machine and the ICS,
this won't work. Here are some recipes for getting around common
kinds of firewalls using special options to XBoard. 
Important: See the paragraph in the below about extra echoes, in
<a href="#Limitations">Limitations</a>.

   <p>Suppose that you can't telnet directly to ICS, but you can telnet
to a firewall host, log in, and then telnet from there to ICS. 
Let's say the firewall is called &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">firewall.example.com</span></samp>&rsquo;. Set
command-line options as follows:

<pre class="example">     xboard -ics -icshost firewall.example.com -icsport 23
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Or in your <samp><span class="file">.Xresources</span></samp> file:

<pre class="example">     XBoard*internetChessServerHost: firewall.example.com
     XBoard*internetChessServerPort: 23
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Then when you run XBoard in ICS mode, you will be prompted
to log in to the firewall host. This works because port 23 is the
standard telnet login service. Do so, then telnet to ICS, using a
command like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">telnet chessclub.com 5000</span></samp>&rsquo;, or whatever command
the firewall provides for telnetting to port 5000.

   <p>If your firewall lets you telnet (or rlogin) to remote hosts but
doesn't let you telnet to port 5000, you may be able to connect to the
chess server on port 23 instead, which is the port the telnet program
uses by default.  Some chess servers support this (including
chessclub.com and freechess.org), while some do not.

   <p>If your chess server does not allow connections on port 23 and your
firewall does not allow you to connect to other ports, you may be able
to connect by hopping through another host outside the firewall that
you have an account on.  For instance, suppose you have a shell
account at &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo.edu</span></samp>&rsquo;. Follow the recipe above, but instead of
typing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">telnet chessclub.com 5000</span></samp>&rsquo; to the firewall, type
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">telnet foo.edu</span></samp>&rsquo; (or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">rlogin foo.edu</span></samp>&rsquo;), log in there, and
then type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">telnet chessclub.com 5000</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Suppose that you can't telnet directly to ICS, but you can use rsh
to run programs on a firewall host, and that host can telnet to ICS. 
Let's say the firewall is called &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">rsh.example.com</span></samp>&rsquo;. Set
command-line options as follows:

<pre class="example">     xboard -ics -gateway rsh.example.com -icshost chessclub.com
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Or in your <samp><span class="file">.Xresources</span></samp> file:

<pre class="example">     XBoard*gateway: rsh.example.com
     XBoard*internetChessServerHost: chessclub.com
</pre>
   <p>Then when you run XBoard in ICS mode, it will connect to
the ICS by using <samp><span class="file">rsh</span></samp> to run the command
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">telnet chessclub.com 5000</span></samp>&rsquo; on host &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">rsh.example.com</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Suppose that you can telnet anywhere you want, but you have to
run a special program called <samp><span class="file">ptelnet</span></samp> to do so.

   <p>First, we'll consider the easy case, in which
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ptelnet chessclub.com 5000</span></samp>&rsquo; gets you to the chess server. 
In this case set command line options as follows:

<pre class="example">     xboard -ics -telnet -telnetProgram ptelnet
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Or in your <samp><span class="file">.Xresources</span></samp> file:

<pre class="example">     XBoard*useTelnet: true
     XBoard*telnetProgram: ptelnet
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Then when you run XBoard in ICS mode, it will issue the
command &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ptelnet chessclub.com 5000</span></samp>&rsquo; to connect to the ICS.

   <p>Next, suppose that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ptelnet chessclub.com 5000</span></samp>&rsquo; doesn't work;
that is, your <samp><span class="file">ptelnet</span></samp> program doesn't let you connect to
alternative ports. As noted above, your chess server may allow you to
connect on port 23 instead.  In that case, just add the option
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-icsport ""</span></samp>&rsquo; to the above command, or add
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">XBoard*internetChessServerPort:</span></samp>&rsquo; to your <samp><span class="file">.Xresources</span></samp> file. 
But if your chess server doesn't let you connect on port 23, you will have
to find some other host outside the firewall and hop through it. For
instance, suppose you have a shell account at &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo.edu</span></samp>&rsquo;. Set
command line options as follows:

<pre class="example">     xboard -ics -telnet -telnetProgram ptelnet -icshost foo.edu -icsport ""
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Or in your <samp><span class="file">.Xresources</span></samp> file:

<pre class="example">     XBoard*useTelnet: true
     XBoard*telnetProgram: ptelnet
     XBoard*internetChessServerHost: foo.edu
     XBoard*internetChessServerPort:
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Then when you run XBoard in ICS mode, it will issue the
command &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ptelnet foo.edu</span></samp>&rsquo; to connect to your account at
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo.edu</span></samp>&rsquo;. Log in there, then type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">telnet chessclub.com 5000</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>ICC timestamp and FICS timeseal do not work through some
firewalls.  You can use them only if your firewall gives a clean TCP
connection with a full 8-bit wide path.  If your firewall allows you
to get out only by running a special telnet program, you can't use
timestamp or timeseal across it.  But if you have access to a
computer just outside your firewall, and you have much lower netlag
when talking to that computer than to the ICS, it might be worthwhile
running timestamp there.  Follow the instructions above for hopping
through a host outside the firewall (foo.edu in the example),
but run timestamp or timeseal on that host instead of telnet.

   <p>Suppose that you have a SOCKS firewall that will give you a clean
8-bit wide TCP connection to the chess server, but only after you
authenticate yourself via the SOCKS protocol.  In that case, you could
make a socksified version of XBoard and run that.  If you are using
timestamp or timeseal, you will to socksify it, not XBoard; this may
be difficult seeing that ICC and FICS do not provide source code for
these programs.  Socksification is beyond the scope of this document,
but see the SOCKS Web site at http://www.socks.permeo.com/. 
If you are missing SOCKS, try http://www.funbureau.com/.

<h2 class="chapter">7 Limitations and known bugs</h2>

<p><a name="index-Limitations-398"></a><a name="index-Bugs-399"></a>There is no way for two people running copies of XBoard to play
each other without going through an Internet Chess Server.

   <p>Under some circumstances, your ICS password may be echoed when you log on.

   <p>If you are connecting to the ICS by running telnet on an Internet
provider or firewall host, you may find that each line you type is
echoed back an extra time after you hit &lt;Enter&gt;. If your Internet
provider is a Unix system, you can probably turn its echo off by
typing <kbd>stty -echo</kbd> after you log in, and/or typing
&lt;^E&gt;&lt;Enter&gt; (Ctrl+E followed by the Enter key) to the telnet
program after you have logged into ICS.  It is a good idea to do this
if you can, because the extra echo can occasionally confuse XBoard's
parsing routines.

   <p>The game parser recognizes only algebraic notation.

   <p>Many of the following points used to be limitations in XBoard 4.2.7 and earlier,
but are now fixed:
The internal move legality tester in XBoard 4.3.xx does look at the game history,
and is fully aware of castling or en-passant-capture rights. It permits castling with
the king on the d file because this is possible in some "wild 1" games on ICS. 
The piece-drop menu does not check piece drops in bughouse to see if you actually hold
the piece you are trying to drop. But this way of dropping pieces should be considered
an obsolete feature, now that pieces can be dropped by dragging them from the holdings
to the board. Anyway, if you would attempt an illegal move when using a chess engine or the ICS,
WinBoard will accept the error message that comes back, undo the move, and let you try another. 
FEN positions saved by XBoard do include correct information about whether castling or
en passant are legal, and also handle the 50-move counter. 
The mate detector does not understand that non-contact mate is not really mate in bughouse. 
The only problem this causes while playing is minor: a "#" (mate indicator) character will
show up after a non-contact mating move in the move list. XBoard will not assume the game
is over at that point, not even when the option Detect Mates is on. 
Edit Game mode always uses the rules of the selected variant,
which can be a variant that uses piece drops. 
You can load and edit games that contain piece drops. 
The (obsolete) piece menus are not active,
but you can perform piece drops by dragging pieces from the holdings. 
Edit Position mode does not allow you to edit the crazyhouse holdings properly. 
You cannot drag pieces to the holding, and using the popup menu to put pieces
there does not adapt the holding counts and leads to an inconsistent state. 
Set up crazyhouse positions by loading / pasting a bFEN, from there you can set the holdings. 
Fischer Random castling is fully understood. 
You can enter castlings by dragging the King on top of your Rook. 
You can probably also play Fischer Random successfully on ICS by typing
castling moves into the ICS Interaction window.

   <p>The menus may not work if your keyboard is in Caps Lock or Num Lock mode. 
This seems to be a problem with the Athena menu widget,
not an XBoard bug.

   <p>Also see the ToDo file included with the distribution for many other
possible bugs, limitations, and ideas for improvement that have been
suggested.

<h2 class="chapter">9 Authors and contributors</h2>

<p><a name="index-Authors-405"></a><a name="index-Contributors-406"></a>
Tim Mann has been responsible for XBoard versions 1.3 and beyond, and
for WinBoard, a port of XBoard to Microsoft Win32 (Windows NT and
Windows 95). H.G.Muller is responsible for version 4.3.

   <p>Mark Williams contributed the initial (WinBoard-only) implementation
of many new features added to both XBoard and WinBoard in version
4.1.0, including copy/paste, premove, icsAlarm, autoFlipView, training
mode, auto raise, and blindfold.  Ben Nye contributed X copy/paste
code for XBoard.

   <p>Hugh Fisher added animated piece movement to XBoard, and Henrik Gram
(henrikg@funcom.com) added it to WinBoard.  Frank McIngvale added
click/click moving, the Analysis modes, piece flashing, ZIICS import,
and ICS text colorization to XBoard.  Jochen Wiedmann ported XBoard to
the Amiga, creating AmyBoard, and converted the documentation to
texinfo.  Elmar Bartel contributed the new piece bitmaps introduced in
version 3.2.  John Chanak contributed the initial implementation of
ICS mode.  The color scheme and the old 80x80 piece bitmaps were taken
from Wayne Christopher's <code>XChess</code> program.

   <p>Chris Sears and Dan Sears wrote the original XBoard.  They were
responsible for versions 1.0 through 1.2.

   <p>Evan Welsh wrote <code>CMail</code>.  Patrick Surry helped in designing,
testing, and documenting CMail.

   <p>Allessandro Scotti added many elements to the user interface of WinBoard,
including the board textures and font-based rendering, the evaluation-graph,
move-history and engine-output window. 
He was also responsible for adding the UCI support.

   <p>H.G. Muller made WinBoard castling- and e.p.-aware,
added variant support with adjustable board sizes,
the crazyhouse holdings, and the fairy pieces. 
In addition he added most of the adjudication options,
made WinBoard more robust in dealing with buggy and crashing engines,
and extended time control with a time-odds and node-count-based modes. 
Most of the options that initially wre WinBoard only have now been back-ported to XBoard.

   <p>Michel van den Bergh provided the code for reading Polyglot opening books.

   <p>Arun Persaud worked with H.G. Muller to combine all the features of the never-released WinBoard 4.2.8
of the Savannah project (mainly by Daniel Mehrmann),
and the never-released 4.3.16 into a unified WinBoard 4.4,
which is now available both from the Savannah web site and the WinBoard forum.

<h3 class="section">10.2 Starting a CMail Game</h3>

<p>Type <samp><span class="file">cmail</span></samp> from a shell to start a game as white. After an opening
message, you will be prompted for a game name, which is optional&mdash;if you
simply press &lt;Enter&gt;, the game name will take the form
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">you-VS-opponent</span></samp>&rsquo;. You will next be prompted for the short name
of your opponent. If you haven't played this person before, you will also
be prompted for his/her email address. <samp><span class="file">cmail</span></samp> will then invoke
XBoard in the background. Make your first move and select
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Mail Move</span></samp>&rsquo; from the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">File</span></samp>&rsquo; menu. See <a href="#File-Menu">File Menu</a>. If all is well,
<samp><span class="file">cmail</span></samp> will mail a copy of the move to your opponent. If you select
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Exit</span></samp>&rsquo; without having selected &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Mail Move</span></samp>&rsquo; then no move will be
made.

<h3 class="section">10.3 Answering a Move</h3>

<p>When you receive a message from an opponent containing a move in one of
your games, simply pipe the message through <samp><span class="file">cmail</span></samp>. In some mailers
this is as simple as typing <kbd>| cmail</kbd> when viewing the message, while in
others you may have to save the message to a file and do <kbd>cmail &lt; file</kbd>
at the command line. In either case <samp><span class="file">cmail</span></samp> will display the game using
XBoard. If you didn't exit XBoard when you made your first move
then <samp><span class="file">cmail</span></samp> will do its best to use the existing XBoard instead
of starting a new one. As before, simply make a move and select
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Mail Move</span></samp>&rsquo; from the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">File</span></samp>&rsquo; menu. See <a href="#File-Menu">File Menu</a>. <samp><span class="file">cmail</span></samp>
will try to use the
XBoard that was most recently used to display the current game. This
means that many games can be in progress simultaneously, each with its own
active XBoard.

   <p>If you want to look at the history or explore a variation, go ahead, but
you must return to the current position before XBoard will allow you
to mail a move. If you edit the game's history you must select
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Reload Same Game</span></samp>&rsquo; from the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">File</span></samp>&rsquo; menu to get back to the original
position, then make the move you want and select &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Mail Move</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
As before, if you decide you aren't ready to make a move just yet you can
either select &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Exit</span></samp>&rsquo; without sending a move or just leave
XBoard running until you are ready.

<h3 class="section">10.4 Multi-Game Messages</h3>

<p>It is possible to have a <samp><span class="file">cmail</span></samp> message carry more than one game. 
This feature was implemented to handle IECG (International Email Chess
Group) matches, where a match consists of one game as white and one as black,
with moves transmitted simultaneously. In case there are more general uses,
<samp><span class="file">cmail</span></samp> itself places no limit on the number of black/white games
contained in a message; however, XBoard does.

<h3 class="section">10.5 Completing a Game</h3>

<p>Because XBoard can detect checkmate and stalemate, <samp><span class="file">cmail</span></samp>
handles game termination sensibly. As well as resignation, the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Action</span></samp>&rsquo; menu allows draws to be offered and accepted for
<samp><span class="file">cmail</span></samp> games.

   <p>For multi-game messages, only unfinished and just-finished games will be
included in email messages. When all the games are finished, they are
archived in the user's archive directory, and similarly in the opponent's
when he or she pipes the final message through <samp><span class="file">cmail</span></samp>. The archive
file name includes the date the game was started.

<h3 class="section">10.6 Known CMail Problems</h3>

<p>It's possible that a strange conjunction of conditions may occasionally
mean that <samp><span class="file">cmail</span></samp> has trouble reactivating an existing
XBoard. If this should happen, simply trying it again should work. 
If not, remove the file that stores the XBoard's PID
(<samp><span class="file">game.pid</span></samp>) or use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-xreuse</span></samp>&rsquo; option to force
<samp><span class="file">cmail</span></samp> to start a new XBoard.

   <p>Versions of <samp><span class="file">cmail</span></samp> after 2.16 no longer understand the old file format
that XBoard used to use and so cannot be used to correspond with
anyone using an older version.

   <p>Versions of <samp><span class="file">cmail</span></samp> older than 2.11 do not handle multi-game messages,
so multi-game correspondence is not possible with opponents using an older
version.

<h3 class="section">11.2 Fairy-Max</h3>

<p>Fairy-Max is a derivative from the World's smallest Chess program micro-Max,
which measures only about 100 lines of source code. 
The main difference with micro-Max is that Fairy-Max loads its move-generator
tables from a file, so that the rules for piece movement can be easily configured
to implement unorthodox pieces. 
Fairy-Max can therefore play a lage number of variants, normal Chess being one of those. 
In addition it plas Knightmate, Capablanca and Gothic Chess, Shatranj, Courier Chess,
Cylinder chess, Berolina Chess, while the user can easily define new variants. 
It can be obtained from:

<h3 class="section">11.4 Crafty</h3>

<p>Crafty is a chess engine written by Bob Hyatt. 
You can use XBoard to play a game against Crafty, hook Crafty up
to an ICS, or use Crafty to interactively analyze games and positions
for you.

   <p>Crafty is a strong, rapidly evolving chess program. This rapid
pace of development is good, because it means Crafty is always
getting better.  This can sometimes cause problems with
backwards compatibility, but usually the latest version of Crafty
will work well with the latest version of XBoard. 
Crafty can be obtained from its author's FTP site:
ftp://ftp.cis.uab.edu/hyatt/.

   <p>To use Crafty with XBoard, give the -fcp and -fd options as follows, where
&lt;crafty's directory&gt; is the directory in which you installed Crafty
and placed its book and other support files.

<h3 class="section">11.5 zic2xpm</h3>

<p>The &ldquo;zic2xpm&rdquo; program is used to import chess sets from the ZIICS(*)
program into XBoard. &ldquo;zic2xpm&rdquo; is part of the XBoard distribution. 
ZIICS is available from:

   <p>ftp://ftp.freechess.org/pub/chess/DOS/ziics131.exe

   <p>To import ZIICS pieces, do this:
     <dl>
<dt>1. Unzip ziics131.exe into a directory:<dd>
     <pre class="example">          unzip -L ziics131.exe -d ~/ziics
</pre>
     <br><dt>2. Use zic2xpm to convert a set of pieces to XBoard format.<dd>
For example, let's say you want to use the
FRITZ4 set. These files are named &ldquo;fritz4.*&rdquo; in the ZIICS distribution.

     <pre class="example">          mkdir ~/fritz4
          cd ~/fritz4
          zic2xpm ~/ziics/fritz4.*
</pre>
     <br><dt>3. Give XBoard the &ldquo;-pixmap&rdquo; option when starting up, e.g.:<dd>
     <pre class="example">          xboard -pixmap ~/fritz4
</pre>
     <p>Alternatively, you can add this line to your <samp><span class="file">.Xresources</span></samp> file:

     <pre class="example">          xboard*pixmapDirectory: ~/fritz4
</pre>
     </dl>

   <p>(*) ZIICS is a separate copyrighted work of Andy McFarland. 
The &ldquo;ZIICS pieces&rdquo; are copyrighted works of their respective

</pre>
   <h3 class="heading">Preamble</h3>

<p>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

   <p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom
to share and change all versions of a program&mdash;to make sure it remains
free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation,
use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it
applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.  You
can apply it to your programs, too.

   <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

   <p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you
have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom
of others.

   <p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too,
receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these
terms so they know their rights.

   <p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

   <p>For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

   <p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the
manufacturer can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the
aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The
systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for
individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. 
Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the
practice for those products.  If such problems arise substantially in
other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those
domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the
freedom of users.

   <p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. 
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish
to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program
could make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL
assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

   <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

<h3 class="heading">TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>

     <ol type=1 start=0>
<li>Definitions.

     <p>&ldquo;This License&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

     <p>&ldquo;Copyright&rdquo; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
of works, such as semiconductor masks.

     <p>&ldquo;The Program&rdquo; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Licensees&rdquo; and
&ldquo;recipients&rdquo; may be individuals or organizations.

     <p>To &ldquo;modify&rdquo; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of
an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &ldquo;modified version&rdquo; of
the earlier work or a work &ldquo;based on&rdquo; the earlier work.

     <p>A &ldquo;covered work&rdquo; means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

     <p>To &ldquo;propagate&rdquo; a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

     <p>To &ldquo;convey&rdquo; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user
through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
conveying.

     <p>An interactive user interface displays &ldquo;Appropriate Legal Notices&rdquo; to
the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

     <li>Source Code.

     <p>The &ldquo;source code&rdquo; for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  &ldquo;Object code&rdquo; means any non-source form
of a work.

     <p>A &ldquo;Standard Interface&rdquo; means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

     <p>The &ldquo;System Libraries&rdquo; of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
&ldquo;Major Component&rdquo;, in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

     <p>The &ldquo;Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

     <p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

     <p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same
work.

     <li>Basic Permissions.

     <p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

     <p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. 
You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having
them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with
facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the
terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not
control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for
you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and
control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your
copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

     <p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

     <li>Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

     <p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

     <p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with
respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit
operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against
the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid
circumvention of technological measures.

     <li>Conveying Verbatim Copies.

     <p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

     <p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

     <li>Conveying Modified Source Versions.

     <p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
conditions:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,
and giving a relevant date.

          <li>The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
under this License and any conditions added under section 7.  This
requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to &ldquo;keep intact all
notices&rdquo;.

          <li>You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This License will
therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms,
to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they
are packaged.  This License gives no permission to license the work in
any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have
separately received it.

          <li>If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work
need not make them do so.
          </ol>

     <p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
&ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

     <li>Conveying Non-Source Forms.

     <p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these
ways:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily
used for software interchange.

          <li>Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written
offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you
offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give
anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the
Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is
covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used
for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable
cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access
to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

          <li>Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written
offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This alternative is
allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you
received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection
6b.

          <li>Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
(gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to copy
the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be
on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports
equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions
next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. 
Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain
obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to
satisfy these requirements.

          <li>Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you
inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of
the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under
subsection 6d.

          </ol>

     <p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

     <p>A &ldquo;User Product&rdquo; is either (1) a &ldquo;consumer product&rdquo;, which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a
consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of
coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user,
&ldquo;normally used&rdquo; refers to a typical or common use of that class of
product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way
in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected
to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of
whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or
non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant
mode of use of the product.

     <p>&ldquo;Installation Information&rdquo; for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to
install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User
Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The
information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of
the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with
solely because modification has been made.

     <p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

     <p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or
updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the
recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or
installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the modification
itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network
or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the
network.

     <p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

     <li>Additional Terms.

     <p>&ldquo;Additional permissions&rdquo; are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. 
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

     <p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

     <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders
of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms
of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

          <li>Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author
attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices
displayed by works containing it; or

          <li>Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

          <li>Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
authors of the material; or

          <li>Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade
names, trademarks, or service marks; or

          <li>Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by
anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with
contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any
liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those
licensors and authors.
          </ol>

     <p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &ldquo;further
restrictions&rdquo; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

     <p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

     <p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the
above requirements apply either way.

     <li>Termination.

     <p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

     <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

     <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

     <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

     <li>Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

     <p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run
a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

     <li>Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

     <p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

     <p>An &ldquo;entity transaction&rdquo; is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

     <p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

     <li>Patents.

     <p>A &ldquo;contributor&rdquo; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's &ldquo;contributor version&rdquo;.

     <p>A contributor's &ldquo;essential patent claims&rdquo; are all patent claims owned
or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, &ldquo;control&rdquo; includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

     <p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

     <p>In the following three paragraphs, a &ldquo;patent license&rdquo; is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To &ldquo;grant&rdquo; such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

     <p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  &ldquo;Knowingly relying&rdquo; means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

     <p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

     <p>A patent license is &ldquo;discriminatory&rdquo; if it does not include within the
scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on
the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically
granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you
are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the
business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the
third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the
work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties
who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent
license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by
you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in
connection with specific products or compilations that contain the
covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent
license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

     <p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

     <li>No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

     <p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey
a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree
to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying
from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could
satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely
from conveying the Program.

     <li>Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

     <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

     <li>Revised Versions of this License.

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or
of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If
the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General
Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
Software Foundation.

     <p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions
of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public
statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to
choose that version for the Program.

     <p>Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

     <li>Disclaimer of Warranty.

     <p>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.

     <li>Limitation of Liability.

     <p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM
TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

     <li>Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

     <p>If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

     </ol>

<h3 class="heading">END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>

<h3 class="heading">How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h3>

<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   <p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the &ldquo;copyright&rdquo; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<pre class="smallexample">     <var>one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.</var>
     Copyright (C) <var>year</var> <var>name of author</var>
     
     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at
     your option) any later version.
     
     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     General Public License for more details.
     
     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program.  If not, see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>.
</pre>
   <p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

   <p>If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

<pre class="smallexample">     <var>program</var> Copyright (C) <var>year</var> <var>name of author</var>
     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">show w</span></samp>&rsquo;.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">show c</span></samp>&rsquo; for details.
</pre>
   <p>The hypothetical commands &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">show w</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">show c</span></samp>&rsquo; should show
the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your
program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would
use an &ldquo;about box&rdquo;.

   <p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a &ldquo;copyright disclaimer&rdquo; for the program, if necessary. 
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>.

   <p>The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But
