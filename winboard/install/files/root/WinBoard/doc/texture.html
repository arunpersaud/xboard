<h3>Using a Bitmap Image for Chess Board</h3>
<p>
WinBoard 4.4 allows the user to use arbitrary images for the board squares.
This feature was first introduced in
<a href="http://www.ascotti.org/programming/chess/winboard_x.htm">Winboard_x</a>.
The images have to be given as a bitmap, and the board squares are cut out of it.
The Winboard_x home page shows some examples of this,
and hosts the bitmap files needed to acheive them for download.
The direct links are listed below.
</p><p>
The first step is to download the image.
Of course you could also provide one yourself.
The format must be bitmap (.bmp), but if you have an image in another format
(.jpg, .gif) you can use MicroSoft Paint to convert it to .bmp;
simply open the image file in Paint, and the use the "File -> Save as..." menu 
to save it as bitmap.
The format in which you save can be selected at the bottom of the save dialog.
</p><p>
You will need two bitmaps, one for the light squares,the other for the dark.
They have to be placed in the folder 'textures',
which is already premade in the WinBoard folder of this package
(~\WinBoard\textures).
The bitmaps will have to be at least 129x129 
(the largest square size used by winBoard),
but using a larger bitmap will provide more variety in the squares that WinBoard 
cuts out of it.
</p><p>
Next step is to tell WinBoard to use the bitmaps.
For this the options /liteBackTextureFile="..." and /darkBackTextureFile="..." exist.
They can be put as arguments on the command line,
in the winboard.ini file, or in special .ini files called from the command line.
</p>
<pre>
/liteBackTextureFile="textures/wood_l.bmp"
/darkBackTextureFile="textures/wood_d.bmp"
/liteBackTextureMode=2
/darkBackTextureMode=2
/overrideLineGap=0
</pre>
<p>
When board textures are used, the black lines between the squares that WinBoard usually draws
often are spoiling the nice look.
With the /overrideLineGap option you can set them narrower, or make them disappear altogether.
(The number gives the width in pixels.)
Note that WinBoard colors these lines for highlighting from- and to-squares of moves,
so if you make the lines invisibly narrow, you better highlight with an Arrow.
(You can enable this form of highlighting in the "Options -> General..." menu.
The TextureMode options determine how squares cut out of the bitmaps are randomly
rotated before being glued together to form the board.
</p>
<h3>Having Many Pre-defined Board Looks</h3>
<p>
If you don't want these settings to be permanently stored in your winboard.ini file,
e.g. because you frequently want to change between different customized looks,
you can put the options listed above in a small .ini file,
such as the ~\WinBoard\wood.ini that was provided with this package.
You can then summon them up at any time by giving "@wood.ini" (without the quotes)
as an extra option on the bottom line of the startup dialog,
or even make a separate shortcut that has this option on the "target" line.
</p>
<h3>Redefining the Piece Symbols</h3>
<p>
For changing the appearence of the pieces, 
you will need to use a true-type font to define the piece symbols.
Such a true-type font can be scaled to any board size.
How to do this is decriped on a separate page of this tutorial.
