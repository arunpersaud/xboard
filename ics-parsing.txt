Parsing of ICS Output
Updated to match xboard/WinBoard 4.0.2
==============================================================================

This document describes how xboard and WinBoard parse ICS output.  The
general parsing method is to compare a list of patterns against the
current line (whether partial or complete) each time new input is
received from ICS.  The patterns are considered in a fixed order.  The
pattern matching is not "anchored", so unmatched text at the beginning
of a line (including the prompt, usually) is skipped.  Whenever a
pattern is matched, the characters are "consumed" and matching begins
again with the next unmatched character, starting at the top of the
list.  The last pattern is "\n", causing characters up to a newline to
be discarded if they have not matched any patterns.  The pattern
language is very simple.  Every character but "*" must match
literally.  "*" matches zero or more characters that don't include a
newline and don't match the character immediately following the *, if
any.  A "*" at the end of a pattern will not match until a complete
line is received

This method of pattern matching is rather fragile.  The patterns have
to be chosen quite carefully to avoid unexpected results.  For
example, at one time "* shouts: *" was used to match shouts, while
"<12>" was used to match the start of a board.  If someone shouted
"<12>", xboard would succeed in ignoring the <12> only if all the
characters from the ">" to the next newline were received at one time,
so that the shout pattern could match before the start-of-board
pattern was considered.  (This usually happens on TCP connections, but
is not guaranteed.)
	
The patterns intentionally allow text in finger notes to be parsed and
colorized as tells, shouts, etc.  I did this because Zek once said
that ZIICS users like this feature, even though he originally
considered it a bug in ZIICS, and so he doesn't dare change it.  I may
eventually change it anyway so that people stop reporting it as a bug.

Here is the complete list of patterns that xboard looks for, in order.
The list was obtained by grepping the source code for "looking_at", my
procedure for pattern-matching.  Some of these are specific to FICS,
some to ICC, and some may be outdated---that is, they may reflect
messages that no ICS produces anymore.  Occasionally the same pattern
appears more than once because earlier occurrences were inside
if/then/else statements.  There may also be a couple of places where I
do a test without calling looking_at.
