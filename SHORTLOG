Thomas Adam (1):
      (tiny change) Clarify "-name" option is Xt-only

Tim Mann (9):
      Use getaddrinfo instead of gethostbyname.  Hopefully this makes us compatible with IPv6 and with hosts that have more than one IP address.  However, I don't know of any chess servers that have either of those properties, so I couldn't test that.  I did test that xboard still works with freechess.org and chessclub.com and that it gives an error message for invalid host names.
      Fix a size mismatch in scanf.  Untested, but the code could not have
      Move "hide thinking" option into alphabetical order.
      Fix display of international characters outside the ASCII range.
      Added "misc-fixed" as a fallback font to handle locales where
      Add a final wildcard default for fonts.  This gives XCreateFontSet
      The empty string can't be translated and it causes the gettext
      Fixed small bugs in several .po files, enabling these translations to
      Internationalize the file browser.
